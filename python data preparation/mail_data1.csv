381,2001-03-15 14:11:00,RE: PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL COMPENSATION INFORMATION,Phillip K Allen,allen-p,Thanks for the information. It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January. I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock. I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%). Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account? Thank you for looking into this issue. Phillip,not important

Unfortunately, that process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate. Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA. Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to be held the first week of Jan. I would like to handle all of these consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this discussion. I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process. Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the title change. Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest convenience. If you need my assistance with this please let me know. I apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.

Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston, TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin, TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin, TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions Cupertino, CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt, On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward. I'd definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply in the very near future. I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably linked. Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg understand that his focus was different than ours. Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process. I have certainly found her involvement invaluable.

What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

Everyone is getting into the act. When I started this gig, I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California. I wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all the important stuff. This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito. His epistle got more press than mine, but why is he muscling in on my turf? Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of California?s power business. No stone left unturned. I?m telling you, there isn?t enough room in this business for all of us. They need to clear out. With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis and Let?s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito? They re-define our reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb. For example, starting in early June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles. Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year. This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for PG&E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculating the PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom. I can?t wait to see what next week will bring. I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and the Governor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things: What?s for lunch? Who will sit at the head of the table? Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention? Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry? Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room? It?s getting too warm. Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena, ignore the facts, and publish a report. It makes one want to take a deep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy. You know, I can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? Well, the answer very clearly is no. I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead they mimic apes. Consider the following. First, they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market. Forgivable in that it is human to err. The prices skyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame. _Must be them damn independent generators,O say their managers. Gary Cotton informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in the Block Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference. There?s one nobel laureate who missed his prime. Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers. Nine offers show up at their table, and they can?t choose any of them. Again, Mr Cotton tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, and we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well, the surfing was good this week so why spoil it? Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&E electricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners. SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills, including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can help by calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap. I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons. No secrets in San Diego. But we are not done. No sir, we are not. Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board. The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX. The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive. In other words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy! What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX. These are sales from their stranded assets. Their grief hasn?t abated their greed. So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not workably competitive. Too much time in the direct sun light. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time. I only read the Executive Summary, and that only because our counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito. I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse entertainment. _California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years. _ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting in over $1 billion in excess payments for electricity. _Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ... _Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity, purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins. _Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to oversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data. Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices, coordinating with other State agencies, including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits. _A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's electric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C. now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power plants. _Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer. The ""Independent System Operator"" (ISO) and the ""Power Exchange"" (PX), the nonprofit private corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets. Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers .... _Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's electric services, the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies. _California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double. California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If California tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulators would likely prevent that action. ... Short-term price relief, however, cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators. _We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues. California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its board members; and the actions of generators in supplying California's energy needs. _Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems From Spreading in 2001: ... 2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning; 3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California wholesale market pricing; 4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets; ... 8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX stakeholder boards; 9. Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhance the State's enforcement capability for power plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming, consistent with protection of proprietary business information; 10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX. _Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ... 4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications to advance clean, BACT+ power plant proposals. 5. Institute ""use-it -or- lose-it"" permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built; ... 8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO I told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore. The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me. Welcome comrade. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting, especially when our favorite topic arises. It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda: price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements. Otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum. %Round and %round we went, once again. A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap. There were 15 yes votes, which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters of your name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO? Kind of a french thing.] I?m sorry about that vote, Jerry. You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long. Your picture in the SF Chron said it all. The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet (Enron), Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), Caolyn Kehrein (CMA), Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble). Now, I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No, spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO. I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem. We?re going to work things out. The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board, again. I didn?t mind that I only had a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and Herr (Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes. That didn?t bother me at all. He did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2. He blasted away at everyone who opposed him. He pined about Camden quitting the Board. He said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way those academic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition. He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife (what was that all about?). He predicted that on Thursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats, Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just and reasonable (it didn?t happen). And on and on and on. This man is very delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can save the world. He believes that political will trumps judicial, quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions. This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) ... The will to power, the ?bermensch, the transvaluation of values, etc. But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press. Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over. Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting. Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, and all of it bad. That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door. >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now, the good news. You deserve this. FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday. FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISO?s intent to lower the price cap. FERC denied the complaint, but they didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint. FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap. Here are some excerpts: _We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers? prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere... _ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs. ... Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability. Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, the resulting overall payments may be higher. _To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), such a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ... Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules. Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section 205 of the FPA.O Well. What do you think about that? Just wait. Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks: _Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid. The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.? _Because these allegations come from a non-market participant, especially should we take heed. We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independence.O Amen, brother, amen. >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable. I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters, very little of which ever sees print. My shtick is just too complex for casual readers. But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions. The public is becoming more savvy. The information flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces of evil, in about 10 years. I have other problems on my mind. I am working on a new computer system. Really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully. As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computer documentation, and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess. Prepare for the future. Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay. Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations, timing, golf, etc. Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms. Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, and William Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO. Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass. Last week we had a joke about Catholics. This week it?s agnostics. ===================== An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that the accident of evolution had created. ""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"" he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him. He tried to run even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster, but he tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him. At that instant he cried out ""Oh my God!"" And time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. The river even stopped flowing. A bright light shone upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, ""You deny my existence all these years, teach others I don't exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident, and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?"" The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, ""It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years, but could you make the bear a believer?"" ""Very well"" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed, the sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both paws together, bowed his head, and said, ""Lord, I thank you for this food which I am about to receive."" ================== Amen. And have a great weekend. Oh, and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes. It was very much appreciated. KSB gba - att1.htm",not important

No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon. The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause. Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F' vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F"" Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not telling who, I received the following: =0F""I ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote. Ugh! I too noted that the ""speak fast"" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace. My goodness, what a mess we have. I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes. My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored] ... for political reasons. Given no Commission meetings til September, the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do all that much.=0F"" >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the PUC/EOB report was very good. I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito. The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's website. =0F""... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. =0F""The Report states that the ISO =0F""never tried=0F"" to call upon consume= rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =0F""The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by =0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F""lock-in=0F"" a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. =0F""In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F""might well= =0F"" have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of peak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control area. =0F""The Report asserts that California power markets =0F""are not now competitive=0F"" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =0F""market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand,=0F"" and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =0F""The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants in the FERC proceedings. =0F""The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=0F"" >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring. Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their facts. Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like. It started over two hours late. The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to heap on the glory. That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese. Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it, and he does, it is always the same story. It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy. They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day. The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable. Last week, San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He said it). He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done listening. People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes. Yikes! Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!! Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem, it is a regional problem. One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a 6 month permitting time line. The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and air offsets. Hmmmmmm. That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC. The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch. I went too hard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch. That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry. I promise to be nicer starting now. The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured. Put it in an escrow account. Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you). The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento. Isn=0F't that a switch? Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord. Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected. When can we do that? Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer. There is a process. It takes time. You must have evidence. FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable. It=0F's based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high prices. You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals. Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12. They were stumped. Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC, today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner. Back and forth: the process, the process, the process. There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC. Today, I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob. For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC. >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well, the official title is, =0F""Order Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas & Electric Company=0F"". I like my title better. This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission, on August 3. It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center. Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address: =0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a= nd small commercial customers?

How should state/federal concerns be addressed? =0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases? Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases? Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole? >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) As promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb Ennis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.

 Henry Bath LA",Michelle Cash,cash-m,"Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice Hoyt and Melissa, I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort of services for MG/RW. It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire. I am not really familiar with the specific facts here. The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their activities, engaging in etc. decisions, and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees. So, if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a supervisor. Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel. If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced. It is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other alternative). Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers. I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion. So, let's try to discuss it. I am booked until about 11 this morning, but am available after that.

This is where an agency employee claims that he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak). Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would have to defend it. I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can advise us on the position we should take. I would think that if we single out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee). Michelle, can you help us with this one? Thanks. Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . . . Enron Europe From: Melissa Laing @ ECT 08/08/2000 10:57 AM To: Hoyt Thomas/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Jeanie Slone/LON/ECT@ECT, Melanie Doyle/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Henry Bath LA Hi Hoyt, I have today spoken to Ed Dablin regarding Henry Bath LA. We discussed how the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are infact agency workers. Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get applicable benefits. The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff. He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly ""muddied the water"" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or the agency. He was not involved with the original decision to grant these employees Share Options. We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy thing to do. However, this is his ideal scenario. How viable is it that we can do this for him? He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees. Regards Melissa",important

Some interesting reading. Although it doesn't explicitly relate to foreign assignments, I am aware that our assignments to and from Europe are predominately white males and I am assuming that this is the case globally as well. I am sure that if Enron was ever filed with a lawsuit for discrimination, this could be an area that would negatively affect the outcome of Enron's defence as foreign assignments generally provide career development opportunities that most non-white males at Enron are missing out on.

This case will be watched very closely because 1) it was filed against Microsoft, and 2) because of the large potential class of plaintiffs. Class action suits are an employers worst nightmare (think Texaco and Coca-Cola). Please feel free to share this with your management. No. 200 Monday, October 16, 2000 Page A-3 ISSN 1522-5968 News Discrimination Suit Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee Alleges Discrimination Based on Race, Sex SEATTLE--A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp. alleging the company maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African American and female salaried employees, affecting pay rates and promotion opportunities (Donaldson v. Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, 10/4/00). Such discrimination at the company ""is the standard operating procedure,"" the lawsuit said. The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. ""We take these kinds of issues very seriously,"" Murray said regarding the lawsuit. The company has an ""active diversity policy"" and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 percent are women. Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft. ""African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment"" at the company, the complaint said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are ""systemic in nature, and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's operations,"" the lawsuit maintains. 'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged The complaint said the company allows ""excessive subjectivity"" in decisions involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained ""either internally or externally about Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them."" The lawsuit said the company ""uses an excessively subjective evaluation system"" that allows managers ""who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit."" Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. ""Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores."" Any employee with a 2.5 score is placed on a ""personal improvement plan"" or asked to resign, the complaint said. ""Stack rankings"" are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. ""Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal popularity with other managers"" because the rankings mix employees working for different managers. In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries ""substantially lower"" than those paid white males doing similar work, with the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit said. Furthermore, ""excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria"" are applied in promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees.

Michelle Enron North America Corp. From: Felecia Acevedo @ ENRON 11/02/2000 08:56 AM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys Michelle, who is GSP? Are they a legal entity? Are they on our payroll? If they are we filed EEO-1's for them. Below is the criteria to file an EEO-1 report: Standard Form 100 must be filed by - A. All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments, primary and secondary school systems, institutions of higher education, Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor organizations; OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees if the company is owned or affiliated with another company, or there is centralized ownership, control or management (such as central control of personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes a single enterprise, and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more employees. B. All federal contractors (private employers), who: (1) are not exempt as provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) have 50 or more employees, and (a) are prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors, and have a contract, subcontract, or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more; or (b) serve as a depository of Government funds in any amount, or (c) is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and Notes. All multi-establishment employers, i.e. employers doing business at more than one establishment, must file: (1) a report covering the principal or headquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing 50 or more persons; (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees by race, sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees; and (4) a list, showing the name, address, total employment and major activity for each establishment employ-ing fewer than 50 persons, must accompany the consolidated report. All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package. For the purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary. The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts. Their line of thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits indirectly from the contract as well. If GSP is completely free standing and they do not participate in Enron's benefits, abide by our policies or procedures , participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be funded by Enron Corp. , etc., they may have some type of argement not to comply but I doubt it. If we own them over 51% I don't see a way they could not file EEO-1's and have an AAP. We do all the AAP's in Corporate so if this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know. Thanks!

We would like to bring them back to do light-duty work, to get them in the swing of working again and also to get some adminstrative work done. I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE HURT HIMSELF AGAIN. In which case, GSP owns it. However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement. He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return to work from worker's comp. I know that we have an ongoing dispute about worker's comp with MG at this point. What would be your recommendation on bringing these employees back to work? As a bit of additional info, one of the two employees seems eager to come back . . . the other one does not.

We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin. The terms of that Agreement would include: 1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters. He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as needed. 2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement). After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard. 3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his employment with Enron. Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following: -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA, -- Kevin's intentional acts, -- Kevin's gross negligence, -- Kevin's reckless conduct, -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other legal obligation, or -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act. 4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01. The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt. In addition, all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of the agreement. Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.

If and when I can do so, I would like to terminate him. I won't until I hear from you all, and we are documenting discussions as you requested.

50246,2001-10-23 22:09:05,Privileged and Confidential -- Performance Bonus Language,"Cash, Michelle </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MCASH>",cash-m,"David, You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance. The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows: ""Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."" This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria. Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria. Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted. As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C). That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus. If there is a decision not to break down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process. Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process. Please let me know if you have any questions.",important

He's the most informed of the bunch and I doubt he would find a general work of interest (unless he can create a platform for his more detailed ideas). If it stays general, I think the study is a good idea. One topic area might be to explore how politicians mess up the basic idea of deregualtion and suggest that the process needs to be handled in a more objective (and pure) fashion.

Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity. That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this ""study"" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it. I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose: to influence the policy decision currently under debate ""To de-regulate or not."" As such, I wouldn't see issues like ""PJM or APX"" or ""competitive default supplier or not,"" or ""divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets"" being the focus. That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in ""Round 2,"" once the initial debate over ""deregulate or not"" is won. To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, ""right"" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably. And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment. In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot. Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on ""how to do it,"" but that would not be the emphasis. In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of ""to deregulate or not,"" and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study. I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the ""go/no go"" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue.

Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back. I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group. It's attached. Please take a look. I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read. Few points worth mentioning: The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron. List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ. The list also includes Hogan and Joskow and Borenstein. We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis. However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., ""de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work."" Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the ""authors"" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course. The analysis would not be a debate over ""To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc."" In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a ""Nixon goes to China"" scenario. Please take a look at the list of participants. Again, we can add to and subtract from the list. Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.) None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum. It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan). The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project. This is for two reasons: 1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study. If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project. Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile. Appreciate your comments.

Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. ""We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,"" said Larry Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. ""We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it, let's pay for it."" Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he said, ""were wildly high."" ""The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, "" Maviglio said. ""Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities, you can't conclude anything."" The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion in debt. PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies. ""The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ""Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large."" Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor. COST VS. OUTAGES If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. ""I don't like either choice,"" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store. ""But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the blackouts."" Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within ""the existing rate structure"" -- a stealthy way of saying that January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place. But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. ""For the good of California, it's inevitable,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry association. Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. ""It's like gasoline,"" he said. ""I don't like paying higher prices for gasoline, but that's the price of doing business."" Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. ""If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,"" said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty. ""But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling blackouts."" ""I'd rather have blackouts,"" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. ""I don't want to pay rates that are so much higher."" NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way. Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond. ""Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,"" said Tom Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison. Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to do so. Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures. ""It adjusts consumer behavior,"" Higgins said. ""People want to get their bills back down."" RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. ""It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,"" Higgins said. Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear: No, no, no. ""No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We need to get back to a regulated system."" Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento. ""We've paid too much already,"" Rosenfield said. ""A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease."" However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. ""Big users should pay more,"" he said after a moment's reflection. ""I'm open to a tiered system but only if it's fair."" Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis. MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months, if not longer. PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. ""I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,"" she said. ""People who use a whole lot of power should pay more."" The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. ""That way, you have more convenience and electricity, more stability,"" she said. But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate increases and rolling blackouts. She's moving to Texas. Chronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this report. / E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

We may have already filled the summer spots (we also cut down the number a bit this year to ensure a higher quality experience), but we will be out looking for a large number of permanent hires in the Fall.

The course is cross-listed between the Haas School of Business and the Energy & Resources Group at UC Berkeley. The syllabus for the course is attached. We have 43 graduate students in the course, most pursuing a masters degree in business or energy & resources, though there are also a few PhD students. These are very smart students -- many of whom already have experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the course puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any energy-related organization that they would join. Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent employment starting as early as May. If Enron has openings that you would like to advertise to these students, please send me the job description (or the URL for it)and I can forward it to the class list. Jim and I think this is a very strong class, and many of the students are interested in making a career in either the business or the public policy side of the energy industry. We're hoping to provide the connections to help make sure they find the best job matches possible. Sincerely, Severin Severin Borenstein E.T.

San Jose Mercury News April 19, 2001, Thursday KR-ACC-NO: SJ-POWER LENGTH: 593 words HEADLINE: Testimony Indicates California Electricity Market Was Troubled in 1998 BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey BODY: ??SACRAMENTO, Calif.--California's electricity market was showing signs of trouble as far back as 1998, the year that it was officially opened to competition, members of a special legislative investigating committee were told Wednesday. ??Abnormal price spikes -- far higher than what should have occurred in a competitive market -- were showing up in August 1998, the committee was told by Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist and top advisor to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid. ??Appearing on the first day of hearings called by a state Senate select committee to investigate alleged wholesale energy price manipulation, Wolak testified that the ISO's economic advisors repeatedly found signs that power suppliers were able to influence prices over the last three years -- even before wholesale prices soared skyhigh last summer. ??By controlling even a relatively small portion of power supply, just enough to make a difference in whether the state could meet consumers' needs, Wolak said, generators have been able to charge prices far higher than their costs. ??All told, the ISO has estimated, power suppliers collected more than $ 6 billion in unjustified profits last year. ??In his opinion, Wolak added, that violates the terms by which federal regulators allowed the suppliers to enter the state's newly deregulated market when it opened in 1998. ??The ISO is now filing petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, asking that agency to revoke the generators' right to charge unregulated prices. ??But Wolak repeatedly told the committee that he had no evidence that the suppliers acted in collusion or that they had violated any federal anti-trust laws. ??When state Senator Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, pressed him on the point, Wolak insisted, ""I can't say yes, I can't say no. There's a lot of things that certainly look puzzling. It's hard without further information and analysis to say definitively, but there's lots of things to seem to be worth looking into."" ??Dunn, a former consumer attorney, is leading the Legislature's efforts to answer a question that a host of other state and federal officials have also posed: have California's electricity prices been the result of any illegal or unethical acts? ??Power suppliers and their representatives have repeatedly said the answer is no. They say their prices are the result of short supplies and natural market swings. ??""Eleven investigations into California's electricity market have been conducted or are currently under way,"" said a statement issued Wednesday by Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. ""Not one has found or proven any wrongdoing by generators."" ??Dunn, however, said Wednesday's testimony was only the start of what he promised would be a vigorous investigation. He said the committee has already asked several power companies for records and other information and he hinted that subpoenas may be issued in the coming weeks. ??""We will try to figure out how to stop these high prices if they are unjustified,"" Dunn said at the beginning of the hearing. ??""We're not going to be looking for ways to finance these payments,"" he added. The state is now paying $ 70 million a day to buy power for California consumers, after major utilities wracked up billions in debts while buying power on the open market in recent months. ??----- ??To see more of the San Jose Mercury News, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sjmercury.com JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 5 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ??????????????????????April 19, 2001, Thursday, BC cycle AM Eastern Time SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 930 words HEADLINE: Developments in California's energy crisis BYLINE: By The Associated Press BODY: ??Developments in California's energy crisis: ??THURSDAY: ??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??- Gov. Gray Davis meets with 25 members of the California congressional delegation at the Los Angeles International Airport to discuss the state's power crisis. ??- An Assembly committee continues hearings on the natural gas supply and possible price manipulation. ??-The Public Utilities Commission meets in San Francisco to decide whether to investigate if a key bloc of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants offline. ??WEDNESDAY: ??- Unchecked free-market forces drove up the price of natural gas to Southern California Edison by about $750 million over the last year, an industry consultant tells the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee. ??Meanwhile, the Senate's Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market begins investigating whether electric generators artificially inflated power prices. ??An industry spokesman predicts the investigations will uncover nothing illegal. ??- The state offers financial backing to Houston-based Dynegy, which worried it would not be paid for power generated at its plants in California. Dynegy agrees to sell 300 megawatts of power from 17 small turbine generators in Carlsbad after receiving an offer from the California Department of Water Resources. ??- Gov. Gray Davis urges state regulators to approve the construction of a controversial 600-megawatt power plant in south San Jose to provide electricity to roughly 450,000 homes in the Silicon Valley. ??- The Democratic governor lobbies Senate Democrats to support his plan to pay $2.7 billion for the transmission lines owned by Southern California Edison. ??State spending on electricity has jumped by more than 50 percent since Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. declared bankruptcy April 6, thanks in part of surcharges tacked on by power generators worried they won't be repaid, Davis said. ??- The Senate Appropriations Committee sends the full Senate a bill creating a public power authority that would loan out up to $5 billion to build or buy power plants that would be required to sell electricity to consumers at low rates. ??- An Assembly committee advances a bill ending the exemption under which utility lobbyists do not have to follow the same reporting requirements as do other lobbyists. The bill now goes to the Assembly Appropriations Committee. ??- A Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. shareholder sues the company, claiming it misled shareholders by forecasting annual profits for two quarters last year when, the suit says, the company knew it was incurring losses. ??-Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch issues a statement late Wednesday, saying inaction by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forced Southern Caifornia Edison Co. to take a large write-off of debt.

Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??- The state Public Utilities Commission will decide Thursday whether to investigate why a key block of power generators is staying off-line despite regulators' order last month that they start getting paid by the state's utilities. Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones says the generators can't afford to operate because they are still owed more than a billion dollars, and because the PUC's rates don't cover their operating costs. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch also wants the commission to decide Thursday to investigate whether PG&E's April 6 bankruptcy protection filing is enough of a threat to the PUC's regulatory authority to prompt more PUC involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying.

LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 Power bloc blasts seizure idea Producers say talk of bold action fuels crisis By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU ?-- Oakland Tribune SACRAMENTO -- Outraged by a report in The Oakland Tribune that some lawmakers asked the governor to seize high-priced power contracts, a key industry group Tuesday warned the Davis administration and Legislature that such action would worsen the energy crisis. ""We're publicly saying . . . this kind of rhetoric will have dire consequences on both the reliability and cost of power in California for years to come,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. ""It is the kind of rhetoric one would expect in Indonesia or the Philippines, not the sixth largest economy on the planet,"" he said in a teleconference. At the same time, Davis administration officials confirmed that seizing contracts of allegedly profiteering brokers is the most likely last-ditch move if options continue to narrow, ahead of the previously discussed concepts of seizing California power plants owned by out-of-state firms or passing a windfall profits tax. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio pointed out the governor already seized power contracts on which California's investor-owned utilities were defaulting in early February. The state, trying to buy its way out of the energy crisis with no clear end in sight, lost a substantial measure of control over electricity prices and supplies to the courts with the recent bankruptcy filing by the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, employed hard-sell tactics Tuesday in an effort to convince reluctant Democrats that their failure to embrace his plan to financially rescue teetering Southern California Edison could plunge that utility into bankruptcy, as well. While most Republicans are flatly opposed to the plan as misguided, Democrats, who hold a majority in the Legislature, worry it's a public bailout of an investor-owned utility and would hand the state control over only Edison's south-state piece of the strategic high-voltage transmission grid in California. Soaring wholesale power costs have financially shattered utilities, forcing the state into runaway, multibillion-dollar spending that helps keep the lights on but threatens the state budget. The manager of the state's power grid has accused generators and marketers of overcharging Californians more than $6 billion in recent months. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Monday that members of both legislative houses were interested in seizure of California power plants' contracts with brokers, who sell to customers within or outside the state. Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, an outspoken critic of the Davis administration's handling of the crisis, said some lawmakers had asked the governor to use emergency or eminent domain powers to seize the overpriced contracts and were awaiting Davis' answer this week. Supporters of the move said seizure would allow the state to control where the power is sold and decrease price markups by eliminating the middleman. But myriad questions remain unanswered, including regulatory and interstate commerce issues as well as any state reimbursement of the brokers. Any move to seize power contracts would be overturned by the courts, said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum. ""Instead of trying to do what's legally within their reach, they go to extreme measures that are on their very face unlawful and unconstitutional,"" Ackerman said. Moreover, industry officials said, seizure would not only chill industry investment in California's power system and lead to higher power costs but would be ironic since California has shunned lower-cost, long-term contracts, industry officials said. ""It would create a very unstable political, regulatory environment,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""It would have extremely adverse consequences for California in the long term."" Even so, the talk has worried the industry. Smutny-Jones said his clients are ""very, very troubled by this sudden turn in rhetoric."" ""I assume when senior members of the Legislature make pronouncements about potentially seizing contracts, it's designed to get our attention and we obviously take those things seriously,"" he said. The Independent Energy Producers group is ""in the process"" of contacting the Davis administration and lawmakers, said Smutny-Jones. ""You'll hear more about this."" Copyright 2001 Copley News Service Copley News Service April 19, 2001, Thursday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 780 words HEADLINE: Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backing BYLINE: Bill Ainsworth DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. ??The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. ??Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. ??Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. ??The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. ??El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. ??Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California ''simply unprecedented'' in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. ??In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, ''qualifying facilities'' that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. ??El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. ??In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. ??Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. ??''I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,'' Davis said. ??Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. ??The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. ??At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. ??''Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,'' said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. ??State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. ??But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. ??''The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,'' FERC ruled. ??In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. ??Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. ??''It baffles me that we've found the problem anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,'' said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.

Not going to happen, Vice President Dick Cheney insists. Don't waste your energy thinking about it. ??""Frankly, California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps,"" Cheney said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ??The vice president was referring to another type of price cap--the infamous state cap on consumer rates that has left the private utilities billions short of enough revenue to pay their gouging wholesalers. What political leaders in California and the Northwest are pleading for from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a regional cap on wholesale prices. ??Early last year, a megawatt-hour was selling wholesale in California for $ 30. By year's end, it had risen to an average $ 300, according to state officials. At peak, prices have soared to $ 1,500. Meanwhile, demand increased last year by less than 4%. In fact, demand last month was 9% less than in March 2000. ??This is the sorry news for ratepayers/ taxpayers: Californians paid $ 7.4 billion for electricity in 1999. This year, the tab--without price caps--is projected at $ 70 billion. Gov. Gray Davis disclosed Tuesday that his administration has been shelling out $ 73 million a day to buy electricity for the pauper utilities. ??The profits of power producers--many of them Texans and Bush backers--have risen 400%-500%-600%. ??* ??But none of this budges the Bush administration. ??Price caps, Cheney declares, may provide ""short-term political relief for the politicians. But they don't do anything to deal with the basic fundamental problem."" That problem is supply, he says; price caps discourage investment in new power plants and encourage consumption. ??Counters Garry South, Davis' political strategist: ""The notion by free market zanies that you have to let profits rise 500%-600% is ludicrous. Reasonable profits can be made without bankrupting the system. They're just trying to protect the profits of their friends in the energy business."" ??In truth, California is building power plants as fast as it can. But not enough new megawatts apparently will be online by summer to prevent blackouts--and the bleeding of billions more into the pockets of out-of-state profiteers. ??How about a temporary price cap? ??""Six months? Six years?"" Cheney replies. ""Once politicians can no longer resist the temptation to go with price caps, they usually are unable to ever muster the courage to end them . . . ??""I don't see that as a possibility . . . Any package you can wrap it in, any fancy rhetoric you can prop it up with, it does not solve the problem."" ??* ??The White House clearly understands it has a problem in California--a political problem. A problem with a Democratic-dominated state that voted overwhelmingly for Al Gore. And now a problem with that mythical headline--Bush to California: Drop Dead--which seems to be getting bigger each day. ??There have been several recent California: Drop Dead stories. One was in Sunday's New York Times--""Bush Devoting Scanty Attention to California."" Tuesday, the Sacramento Bee reported that when Cheney met with Northwest members of Congress to discuss West Coast energy, he barred Californians from the room. ??Cheney flatly denies it. ??But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has had trouble making contact with the Bush White House. She has sent two letters to President Bush asking for a meeting on energy. The first time, she got back a form letter with her name misspelled. On the second try, she got a group meeting with Cheney. ??""It was very disappointing,"" she says. ""He spoke about letting the free market work and drilling in Alaska . That's not going to help California in the short-term. We need price caps until we're able to fix this very broken market. . . ??""There seems no interest in really wanting to understand the California situation."" ??I asked Cheney whether he sensed an anti-California bias across the country? ""No more than there's an anti-Texas bias,"" he replied. ""I wouldn't get paranoid about it. ??""The fact is, California is one of the leading states in the nation. Often a trendsetter. . . . Well, we hope not to emulate your energy policy. Hopefully, we'll learn from that."" ??His message to California: ""There's no reason not to be optimistic. The energy crunch obviously is a significant problem. . . . But it too will pass."" ??While learning from California, the Bush White House also might take a refresher course in the free market Hoover administration. LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 63 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ????????????????????April 19, 2001, Thursday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 1373 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; DAVIS BACKS SILICON VALLEY POWER PROJECT; ENERGY: GOVERNOR URGES QUICK APPROVAL OF SAN JOSE PLANT DESPITE OPPOSITION BY CITY AND A POWERFUL FIRM. BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN and TERENCE MONMANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Attempting to show that no region in California is safe from sacrifice, Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday called for quick state approval of a controversial power plant proposed for the Silicon Valley. ??The governor's action locks him in combat with the San Jose City Council, which has unanimously rejected the plant, and Cisco Systems, the computer networking giant that wants to build its worldwide headquarters on adjacent land. ??In praising the proposed plant as a model of low-polluting efficiency, Davis said all regions of California must share the pain as the state expands its power supply--a key step toward ending blackouts and reducing sky-high electricity prices. ??If approved, the plant would be the 14th licensed by the California Energy Commission since Davis took office. The 13th--a 510-megawatt plant near San Diego--was approved unanimously by the commission Wednesday with little controversy. ??Rushing to expand the state's overtaxed energy supply, the governor has recently cut in half the approval times for the licensing of some plants. Six are under construction, according to Davis, and three are scheduled to begin operation this summer. A fourth--the AES Corp. generator in Huntington Beach that is due to be restarted --could add more megawatts to the supply this summer. ??V. John White, an energy consultant in Sacramento, said the governor's newly active role as an advocate for power plants was a necessary step given the urgency of the supply shortage. ??""It's very rare, and I wouldn't want him to short-circuit the commission's review process,"" White said. ""But I think he's trying to reassure folks we're doing everything we can and not just sitting around in our hot tubs."" ??Davis urged the Energy Commission--a five-member panel dominated by his appointees--to stop talking about the project and grant it a license. If the commission does so, it will mark only the third time the panel has usurped a local government's authority over zoning. ??""We are all in this together,"" Davis said, flanked by a forest of electric transformers near the Capitol. ""We are one state, and we all have to make the sacrifices necessary to make up for the mistakes of the last 12 years, when no major power plants were built."" ??The governor said the plant's developers, Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Holdings Inc., have made ""numerous concessions"" to San Jose officials, including an agreement to sell power exclusively in the region. ??He added that the $ 300-million plant--expected to supply about 450,000 homes--will be equipped with state-of-the-art systems that make it ""one of the cleanest plants to go up in the nation."" ??The commission's staff has recommended licensing the project, and some analysts said the governor's intervention--said to be unprecedented--should fuel momentum for approval. ??Commissioner Robert Laurie--one of two members who held evidentiary hearings on the project and is preparing a recommendation for the full commission--would not comment on the plant's prospects. But Laurie, an appointee of former Gov. Pete Wilson, insisted that the project would receive an impartial review. ??""I know the importance of independent decision-making,"" he said. ??San Jose officials say the Calpine project conflicts with the aesthetics of its site in a bucolic valley 15 miles south of downtown. On Wednesday, Mayor Ron Gonzales urged the Energy Commission to ""give serious attention"" to the city's concerns about the plant's potential impact on residents and the environment. ??""As the project has been designed and proposed to operate . . . it would present an unfair burden to our community,"" the mayor said. ??A spokeswoman for the Calpine/Bechtel partnership disagreed and characterized the plant as key to restoring energy stability in the Silicon Valley, a region heavily dependent on imported power. ??""This is the only project in the pipeline that can help Silicon Valley out of its predicament in the near future,"" said the spokeswoman, Lisa Poelle. ??She expressed hope that the governor's comments, which cap numerous meetings between the partnership staff and Davis aides, would encourage San Jose to soften its stance on the project. ??The 600-megawatt plant is proposed for a swath of open space currently leased to a rancher and occupied by grazing cattle. A preliminary ruling by Laurie and the other commissioner scrutinizing the project is expected by June. The full commission would take a final vote about a month later, and if a license were granted, the plant would begin operations sometime in 2003. ??From the beginning, the plant has been dogged by opposition, and the Energy Commission has held more than 20 hearings--an unusually large number--on its fate. ??On Wednesday, a spokesman for its heftiest foe, San Jose-based Cisco, said the company still has serious concerns about ""health and safety issues."" ??Cisco has strongly opposed the plant because the company wants to build a $ 1.3-billion headquarters for 20,000 employees nearby. In the past, Cisco officials have threatened to relocate to another state if the power plant is built. ??Company spokesman Steve Langdon said the firm's plans to build an industrial campus were not scuttled by the announcement Monday that it is cutting 8,500 workers from its payroll because of slumping sales of its Internet networking equipment. ??But he suggested that the plans were flexible enough to be scaled down for a smaller work force and that the campus may not house the company's headquarters. ??""It doesn't all get built at once,"" he said. ""We will build and occupy the site over time in phases as needed."" ??Another leading opponent of the power plant argued Wednesday that the Energy Commission lacks authority to override San Jose officials and license the project. The Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group, launched by homeowners near the site, says the commission may only take such a step if a better plant site hasn't been identified. ??The group charges that the commission is aware of other available sites, including one in an industrial part of the East Bay area, and lists eight other reasons the plant should not be built, among them the noise and emissions it would produce. ??The local Sierra Club chapter, however, has endorsed the plant largely on grounds that it would run cleaner than existing plants in the area. By offsetting emissions from those older plants, the new project would actually reduce air pollution, said Kurt Newick of the Sierra Club's Loma Prieta chapter. ??On another front, Davis continued to lobby legislators for support for his plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy through purchase of the utility's transmission grid. ??Emerging from lunch with state Senate Democrats who are openly wary of the deal, Davis said he'd made progress to ""bridge some of the gaps."" It was the governor's third meeting in two days with lawmakers of both parties. ??Some of the toughest skeptics are members of his own party in the Senate. Many fear that the deal Davis struck with Edison will hand the utility too much at the expense of ratepayers, and some say bankruptcy might be a better option for the state's second-largest private utility. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy April 6. ??To assuage concerns, Davis proposed that a special Senate committee be named to meet with his energy advisors as the administration and Edison finalize details of the deal before it goes to the Legislature for approval. ??Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who has called the Edison agreement ""problematic,"" said he may appoint such a committee but continued to suggest that an Edison bankruptcy might be acceptable. ??""Many of the Fortune 100 companies have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and it ain't like the end of the world for anybody,"" Burton said. ??* ??Times staff writer Carl Ingram contributed to this story. ??Powering Up California ??Power plant projects recently licensed by the California Energy Commission and when they are expected to go online: ??* ??* Two of four turbines are expected to go online in December 2001; the other two are expected to go online in March 2002. ??Source: California Energy Commission GRAPHIC: PHOTO: (2 photos) Gov.

Consequently, its customers' power rates are expected to be stable this year while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers face huge rate increases. ???But municipal utilities such as Alameda's are still part of the statewide power grid, which is managed by the Independent System Operator, and are subject to rolling blackouts like everybody else when the state's energy reserves dip below 1.5 percent. ???Each of Alameda's four diesel generators will produce 1.5 megawatts of power. Each megawatt can light up 1,000 homes, utility officials say. ???The units, leased at a total cost of $68,000 a month through the end of the year, are parked at Alameda Point. ???Their cost will be paid through the municipal utility's reserve fund and customers' power bills won't be affected, said Junona Jonas, the utility's general manager. ???""I think in the long run, we'll see more supply in the state, but until that happens, there will be communities that'll have to take these short-term drastic measures,"" Jonas said. ???The utility's spokesman, Matthew McCabe, said the diesel exhaust from the generators won't be an environmental factor. ???""Our environmental record is extremely important to us,"" McCabe said. ""The diesel generators are only for emergency backup. . . . Besides, these things are clean -- it's not like standing next to a diesel bus."" ???The city is also getting help from the U.S. Maritime Administration, which operates more than a dozen ships at the former Navy station in Alameda. When the juice is low, those ships will unplug from the port and use onboard generators, Jonas said. ???In the North Bay, Healdsburg officials are waiting for the arrival of two diesel generators. Combined, they are expected to produce 3.5 megawatts of power, which can account for about 20 percent of the city's expected summer peak load, said Bill Duarte, city utility director. ???""We're taking matters into our own hands,"" he said. ???Farther south, both Santa Clara and Palo Alto are considering leasing portable generators, officials said. ???Bill Reichmann, senior electric utility engineer at Santa Clara's Silicon Valley Power, said the utility is planning to lease eight generators, operating them in the southeastern end of town near the San Jose International Airport. ???Palo Alto's municipal utility also has recommended that the City Council approve renting two generators starting next month, said spokeswoman Rima Johnson.E-mail Matthew Yi at myi@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis' assertion that the state is being gouged by power companies because of PG&E's bankruptcy filing. ???Such dissent from the governor's own subordinates could make it harder for Davis to gain support for his energy measures in the state Legislature. ???Despite Davis' latest claims, the Department of Water Resources, which is spending about $70 million a day buying power, said there is no evidence linking recent price increases to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. ???""It is a seller's market,"" said Viju Patel, executive manager of the Department of Water Resources' power systems department. ""The power companies do not need an excuse to raise prices."" ???Critics say Davis' penchant for secrecy on energy issues has come back to haunt him at a time when he needs all the allies he can find. ???""People aren't taking his words at face value,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ???Republican lawmakers -- and even some Democrats -- have challenged a number of the governor's initiatives, including a multibillion-dollar bailout scheme for Southern California Edison. ???Nevertheless, Davis reiterated his belief yesterday that recent electricity price increases are ""an aberration driven by the bankruptcy of PG&E."" ???He said California's spending on power jumped 40 percent in the week following PG&E's bankruptcy filing because generators say they face a greater risk of not being paid. ???""Nothing else in the equation has changed,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor. ""Everything is the same except the bankruptcy."" ???However, power companies were quick to challenge this assertion. They insisted that PG&E's bankruptcy actually was seen as a positive development by those in the energy business. ???""If anything, PG&E provides some solace for traders because the bankruptcy provides an organized mechanism for recovery of payments,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy-industry association. ???On the other hand, he acknowledged that power companies are becoming increasingly wary of the state of California's creditworthiness as an energy buyer. ???The Department of Water Resources already has spent nearly $5 billion buying electricity and has yet to recoup a dime from ratepayers. State regulators are still trying to come up with a way to apportion the limited revenues from power rates among the various parties in California's energy picture. ???Rating agency Fitch Inc. said yesterday it may cut the state's credit rating because of questions surrounding recovery of energy costs. ???""People are keeping an eye on things,"" Ackerman said. ""They're watching how California finances things."" ???If a premium on electricity sales to the state exists, he said it probably has been in place since the beginning of the year, well before PG&E's current woes. ???UCAN's Shames agreed. He said power companies added a ""risk premium"" to their California power sales late last year when it looked like the state's energy troubles were worsening. ???""PG&E's bankruptcy may have increased the uncertainty,"" Shames said, ""but we've been paying a risk premium for months now."" ???Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, insisted that his company's traders are not using questions about PG&E's or California's financial solvency as a fresh excuse for higher prices. ???""I haven't seen any evidence of it,"" he said. ???Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston's Enron Corp., laid blame for recent price increases on low rainfall throughout the West, which has cut output at hydroelectric facilities, as well as on California's chronic power shortage. ???""It's not that there's a premium on prices,"" he said. ""It's just supply and demand."" ???That said, Palmer acknowledged that California's firm insistance on blackouts being avoided at all costs leaves the state vulnerable to virtually any price generators choose to demand. ???""This means prices will be used to allocate a scarce resource,"" he said. ""There's no other way it could work."" ???Bottom line for consumers: It's going to be a long, hot summer, and electricity prices will soar even higher as demand surges. ???And despite the best efforts of state officials, a daily threat of blackouts remains a virtual certainty as California's beleaguered power grid is stretched to the breaking point. ???At the Department of Water Resources' command center in a Sacramento shopping mall, the state's team of electricity traders has moved onto a new, high-tech trading floor, where they negotiate power deals each day from the crack of dawn. ???The department's Patel said daily blackouts may be averted this summer after consumers see skyrocketing power prices reflected in their bills. ???""People will respond to these prices and they are going to conserve like never before,"" Patel predicted.E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis urged the state Energy Commission yesterday to approve a controversial power plant in San Jose, saying California needs every megawatt it can harness. ???Davis' recommendation runs counter to the wishes of the San Jose City Council and Mayor Ron Gonzales, who have come out against the 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in south San Jose's Coyote Valley. It also puts the governor at odds with one of his political allies, Cisco Systems chief John Chambers, whose company opposes the plant because it would be built near the tech firm's proposed new campus. ???Davis' announcement came the same day he all but admitted he lacks the support he needs in the state Senate for the deal he reached with Southern California Edison to restore the utility to financial health. Davis has portrayed that deal and construction of new power plants as essential to making California's energy market functional again. ???""I think when we have an opportunity to put more power on line we should seize it,"" Davis said. ""I believe we spend too much time talking about Metcalf. It's time to start building it."" ???The Energy Commission has been reviewing the proposal by Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Inc. for months. The commission's staff recommended in October that the plant be built, and a final decision is expected by summer. If it is approved, the plant could come on line next year and provide enough electricity for 600,000 homes. ???None of the five commissioners could be reached yesterday. Three are Democrats appointed by Davis and two are Republicans appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. ???Gonzales and the rest of the City Council rejected the Metcalf plant in November. Until yesterday, Davis had sat on the sidelines as the energy crisis deepened and a long line of state and federal officials, including four of the five Assembly members from Silicon Valley, urged the commission to overturn the council's vote. ???Some neighborhood groups oppose the plant, along with computer networking giant Cisco, which hopes to build a 20,000-worker campus on a neighboring parcel. Cisco chief Chambers donated $50,000 to Davis in the first six months of last year. ???Cisco's reaction yesterday was restrained. ???""We have great respect for the governor and respect his decision,"" said Cisco spokesman Steve Langdon. ???However, Langdon added: ""We still have serious concerns about health and safety issues related to the proposed power plant."" ???Some neighbors were much angrier. ???""He's trying to act like he's the big, bad tough governor, and he's spineless,"" said Issa Ajlouny, who lives in the Santa Teresa neighborhood, less than a mile from the proposed plant. ""He knows the approval process isn't working in his favor, so he's trying to come out and act like a hero to the state of California. But he's nothing but backstabbing the city of San Jose on the environmental issues."" ???Supporters of the plant see the 14 acres of former junkyard as the perfect site -- right next to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s largest substation in the South Bay, close to major transmission lines and shielded from its neighbors by a 350-foot hill. ???But a housing development is also nearby, and residents fear the power plant will belch pollutants in an area already suffering from some of the worst air quality in the Bay Area. ???Mayor Gonzales continued to express his concern yesterday. ???""I would support clean power plants that will help us achieve greater energy self-sufficiency for San Jose residents and business,"" Gonzales said. ""As the Metcalf project has been designed and proposed to operate, however, it would present an unfair burden on our community."" ???That's not what Davis said, however, calling Metcalf ""one of the cleanest, most efficient plants in the country."" ???Davis praised the efforts of Calpine/Bechtel to work with the local community and said he was especially pleased that the venture had agreed to commit all the power to the local region. ???""The Silicon Valley is obviously the engine driving our economy, but they are very dependent on outside power,"" Davis said. ???Also in Sacramento yesterday, after an hourlong session with Senate Democrats -- the toughest legislative sell for Davis' proposed Edison deal -- the governor all but admitted his plan could not win enough votes for Senate approval. ???""I think he knew there weren't enough votes going in,"" said Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland. ""But there may be a way of perfecting a deal people can at least think of supporting."" ???Senate Democrats have openly opposed Edison's deal, saying the only beneficiaries are Edison shareholders and power generators who would be paid every cent owed them by the utility -- at the expense of customers who would pay more to erase Edison's debt. ???Unlike his meeting with Assembly Democrats, after which Davis said he was encouraged, the governor said yesterday he wanted the Senate to appoint a special committee to iron out differences over the Edison deal. ???Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said he was ""not aware a committee was being set up.""

Hydro's credit to California firms exceeded 1999 guidelines BYLINE: David Baines SOURCE: Vancouver Sun BODY: ??A confidential document issued in late 1999 shows that B.C. Hydro's power-trading subsidiary, Powerex, set a credit limit of $100 million US for its California customers. ??However, by the end of 2000, Powerex had extended three times that amount of credit to those customers -- the California Independent System Operator and the California Power Exchange. With the California Power Exchange and Cal-ISO's major customer, Pacific Gas & Electric, under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, repayment of this debt is now in doubt. ??Powerex spokesman Wayne Cousins noted that the document obtained by The Vancouver Sun, which is marked ""strictly confidential,"" was issued in November 1999. ??""That's an old copy of our risk-management policy,"" he said in an interview Wednesday. ??""Credit limits have changed since then based on careful assessment of several factors including market conditions, risks, maintaining long-standing relationships and helping California meet its electricity needs to prevent crisis situations. ??""Temporary revisions were only implemented after very diligent review incorporating the best market intelligence available, our own due diligence and on-going dialogue with appropriate market participants."" ??He refused to say when the credit limits for Cal-ISO and the California Power Exchange were increased. ??""That type of information is confidential. You have a copy that, I assume, was leaked in some way, but this is commercially confidential information."" ??He said the increase in credit limits helped B.C. Hydro achieve record net income of about $1 billion during the year ending March 31. This figures does not include any write-downs that may occur if Powerex determines that any of its customer accounts are not collectible. ??Cousins, however, was insistent that all debts will be collected: ""We continue to pursue monies owing and we expect to be paid for electricity we have sold."" ??He noted that Powerex suspended trades to all California entities on Dec. 8 unless those trades were fully secured by creditworthy customers. ??By that time, Cal-ISO and California had racked up an unpaid bill of about $ 300 million US, or $475 million Cdn -- about half the net income that Hydro has tentatively reported for the year ending March 31. ??The confidential document states that Powerex's policies and procedures are designed to control ""the risk of financial loss due to changes in market prices or volatility"" and ""the risk that a counterparty (customer) in a commodity transaction defaults on delivery and/or settlement."" ??It states that the amount of credit to be advanced to any customer depends on its credit rating. An ""AAA"" customer, for example, may be granted credit to a maximum of $20 million. ??Cal-ISO and California Power Exchange are not utilities, they are power pools. They purchase power from Powerex and other suppliers and re-sell it to utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. ??The pools are not rated, but are assigned specific credit limits. As of November 1999, Cal-ISO had a credit limit of $40 million US and the California Power Exchange $60 million US. ??The risk-management document notes that the credit-worthiness of these pools depends on that of its suppliers. ??""The Powerex credit-risk manager and the treasury manager are responsible for initially evaluating, and then monitoring, the credit-authorization policies and credit limits for each power pool in which Powerex trades,"" the document states. ""Significant alterations in the credit policies of a power pool will trigger a mandatory reappraisal of the power-pool credit limit."" ??California has been caught in a power vice in recent months. The problem dates back to 1996, when the state developed a plan to deregulate the electricity business. Competition was supposed to lower rates below a price cap that had been imposed. ??However, dry conditions cut the ability to generate hydro-electric power and a surge in the state's economy created unprecedented demand for electricity. Prices soared. ??The result was that the California utilities paid record prices for power, but weren't allowed to pass along the full cost to consumers. ??Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's two biggest utilities, now owe about $12 billion. ??dbaines@pacpress.southam.ca TYPE: Business LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 63 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ?????????????????????April 18, 2001, Wednesday, BC cycle SECTION: Business News LENGTH: 348 words HEADLINE: Williams again target of overcharging allegations from federal regulators DATELINE: TULSA, Okla.

BODY: ??Gov. Mike Johanns and Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., said Wednesday they will be working to make sure national leaders understand Nebraska's stance on a national energy policy. ??Nebraska's unique status as the only 100 percent public power state in the nation and its reliance on the corn-based fuel additive ethanol make the state's input in the development of national energy policy important, Johanns said. ??""Public power has worked very well for Nebraska consumers by providing low cost electricity,"" he said, adding that the deregulated state of California has suffered through weeks of rolling blackouts. ""We are committed to protecting public power in this environment of deregulation."" ??Terry said he has talked at length to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, who has been tapped to come up with a national energy policy draft. That draft will end up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which Terry serves. ??""There will be a discussion about a national deregulation policy,"" Terry said. ??A national deregulation policy would threaten Nebraska's public power system, Terry and Johanns said.

Gray Davis is expected to announce today his support for Calpine Corp.'s proposed South San Jose power plant -- a move that could ensure the state's most controversial power project is built. ??Davis said for months that he would not interfere in the environmental review of the proposed 600-megawatt power plant. But a source close to the governor said Davis has decided to use Calpine's Coyote Valley project to send a signal that California is ready to build more power plants and is ""open to business."" ??San Jose has strenuously opposed the power plant. But Davis' decision to urge the California Energy Commission to approve it would likely hold sway with the agency, which has authority over where plants are located but has almost never overridden local opposition. ??The commission -- three of whose five members were appointed by Davis -- is expected to complete its environmental review and make a decision early this summer. ??A spokesman for the governor declined to confirm the endorsement. But late Tuesday, the governor scheduled a press conference for this morning to make an ""important energy generation announcement."" ??San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales declined to comment. But another of the plant's leading opponents pledged to keep fighting what would be the South Bay's largest power plant. ??An endorsement from Davis would cap a stunning turnaround for the project. ??Five months ago, Calpine's Metcalf Energy Center was unanimously rejected by the San Jose City Council, which decided that the power plant would be incompatible with the city's plans to develop high-tech campuses in North Coyote Valley. ??Some Calpine officials even considered giving up plans to build the power plant. ??But as California's energy woes intensified, the Metcalf plant increasingly became a poster child for the need for more power generation to reduce the skyrocketing cost of electricity and avoid rolling blackouts. Silicon Valley, one of the state's largest electricity consumers, produces only a fraction of the energy it uses. ??Despite fierce opposition from local residents concerned about the environmental effects of a large power plant, a steady stream of state and local organizations lined up behind the project, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce and the local chapters of the Sierra Club and American Lung Association. ??The California Assembly voted unanimously in February to urge the energy commission to override San Jose and license the power plant. ??And top officials and attorneys at the energy commission have been working for months to ensure that the project wins approval, a Mercury News investigation of the commission's environmental review of the project showed. The officials undermined negative environmental assessments of the Metcalf site and silenced commission analysts who said other sites would be better. ??The energy commissioners are weighing the staff's recommendation to approve the plant. ??Commissioner Robert A. Laurie, who oversaw hearings on the project, insisted at one hearing two months ago that the commission would complete an independent review. ??Although Davis has stressed his efforts to speed construction of new power plants, the governor insisted he would not take a position on the project. ??""The governor has repeatedly said he wants the process to play out,"" Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said last week. ""The governor believes the energy commission should complete its review."" ??But there have been growing signs that Davis would throw his weight behind Calpine's project. ??A senior energy commission official said aides to the governor have been calling the commission for months to urge quick approval of the Metcalf plant. The governor's press secretary said no calls have been made. ??When Davis was looking for a backdrop to hold a press conference earlier this year to announce his plans to speed up approval of new power plants, he chose Calpine's new plant in Sutter. ??The company also has actively campaigned for the governor's support. ??Earlier this year, Calpine offered to sell the state cheaper power from the plant if it is approved. ??When Calpine and its development partner Bechtel Enterprises were looking for a lobbyist in Sacramento, the companies turned to Platinum Advisors, whose president, Darius Anderson, was finance chairman of Davis' 1998 gubernatorial campaign. ??The San Jose-based company gave the governor $ 19,000 last year, according to state campaign finance reports. ??Maviglio said the governor's ties to Calpine are no different from his relationship with Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers, who has opposed the power plant. Campaign finance reports show Chambers gave Davis $ 50,000 last year. ??Calpine officials said Tuesday they did not know of the governor's impending announcement. But they said they were not surprised. ""We've been working with the governor on a number of issues,"" said project manager Ken Abreu. ""Metcalf is just one of them."" ??Meanwhile, Calpine's opponents in San Jose City Hall and in the neighborhood nearest the proposed power plant appear more isolated than at any time since the contentious debate over the Metcalf site began more than two years ago. ??Mayor Gonzales refused to comment on Davis' planned announcement. ""I don't respond to rumors,"" said the mayor, who has helped lead opposition to Metcalf. ""I have not heard anything. If he makes a statement, I'll respond."" ??But one of Calpine's fiercest local opponents said the nearby Santa Teresa neighborhood will continue to fight.

BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis indicated Wednesday that he may need to alter the agreement to purchase Southern California Edison's transmission lines if he wants legislators to approve the deal. ??Though the Democratic governor declined to discuss particulars, he said he asked Senate leaders to appoint a special committee dedicated to resolving disagreements between the administration and lawmakers. ??Many provisions of the memorandum of understanding, the document that lays out the terms of the Edison deal, must be approved by the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission. ??""There is a determination to try and solve this problem whether or not it means amending the MOU or trying a slightly different approach,"" Davis said after meeting with Senate Democrats. ??A spokesman for the utility declined to comment on the governor's statements. ??Davis announced the Edison agreement April 9, just three days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unexpectedly cut off transmission line negotiations with the governor and filed for bankruptcy protection. ??The deal would require the state to pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission lines, or 2.3 times book value. In addition, a portion of consumer electricity rates would be dedicated to paying off the remainder of the utility's debt, estimated at about $5 billion. ??Both Edison and PG&E stockpiled massive debt when wholesale electricity prices soared. Price caps prevented them from passing along the entire cost of electricity to consumers. ??Since the Edison deal was announced, however, legislators have been critical of certain provisions, suggesting that California consumers will receive little in return for relieving the utility of billions of dollars in debt. ??""It's clear that the deal, as is, could well be problematic,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""This has to do with what's in the bill, what's in it for the people of the state."" ??Lawmakers initially believed they would have little ability to change the agreement, and referred to it as a ""take it or leave it"" deal. ??In fact, the memorandum of understanding itself says the deal can be nullified ""in the event any law is passed, adopted or repealed ... (which) would materially impede or frustrate the ability of the Parties to effectuate all of the elements of the plan as a package."" ??But in his meeting with Senate Democrats, Davis indicated he may be willing to compromise. His goal, he said, is to keep Edison from following PG&E into bankruptcy. ??""We still have some work to do,"" Davis said. ""I think the appointment of a special Senate committee, assuming that happens, will let us work through the detail in an appropriate fashion."" ??Burton said he has not decided whether to appoint a committee. ??Other senators came out of the meeting guardedly optimistic that they could compromise with the governor. ??""It was obvious that there were concerns from members,"" said Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda. ""He is open and ready to have the proposal perfected as it moves through the legislative process."" ??Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she hopes to amend the deal to ensure power generators are penalized for over-charging the utilities and the state for electricity. ??""The way it's presently crafted, (generators) are being rewarded,"" she said. ""They are getting a premium for selling electricity at a higher premium than ever conceived of by humankind."" ??(Contact Emily Bazar and Kevin Yamamura of the Sacramento Bee in California at http://www.sacbee.com.)

From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen 489 percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent jump in Chicago. ??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co. subsidiary, for an explanation. ??""The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to constraints on the pipeline and demand?"" Steinberg asked. ??""Yes,"" Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis, which led power plants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than the year before exacerbated the problem. ??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E's movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. ??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said federal regulators should impose price caps on California's wholesale electricity market. ??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for re-regulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing nothing to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration. ??""I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president,"" said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 715 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES; LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL. BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then get a rebate in the mail. ??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced by the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates. ??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis an ""urgency"" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor had previously fought for and defended. ??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value. ??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will ""expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs."" ??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the rebates last year, when he said Californians ""don't appreciate the fact that they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands."" ??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the car tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which Davis felt would have a greater impact. ??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002, when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have fallen permanently, with no more rebates. ??""The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial election cycle,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates. ??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of their license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year. ??""Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction of 67.5%,"" said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on July 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut. ??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current ""awkward system . . . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and then await a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to explain."" ??But as the California economy tightened, the state's budget surplus shrank and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy electricity, the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment to Davis. ??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year. ??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed. ??""It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,"" McClintock said Thursday. ""He didn't want it on his desk."" ??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it as the lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) was substituted. ??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis' performance on the issue in an ""earlier time and a more just society"" would have resulted in his ""public flogging by representatives of taxpayers."" ??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent to Davis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday. ??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in order to take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because motorists must be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due. ??""We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail them by May 1 for the July 1 expiration,"" he said. ""It will be a little tight, but we will still make it."" ??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates, checks totaling $ 454 million have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra administrative cost of $ 9.4 million.

Bill Lockyer, ratcheting up his investigation of possible civil and criminal violations by the state's power suppliers, is asking a San Francisco judge to order two firms to hand over confidential records. ??In a motion filed Thursday in Superior Court, Lockyer said Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. have failed to comply with subpoenas for documents that were to be produced by March 19. ??Amid soaring electricity costs and rolling blackouts, the attorney general launched an investigation of possible manipulation of wholesale electricity prices that have skyrocketed to record levels and have financially crippled the state's major utilities. ??Dozens of other public and private power suppliers are complying with the subpoenas. ??But in an interview, Lockyer accused Reliant and Mirant of stonewalling investigators ""so they can keep enjoying these exorbitant profits and prices for as long as possible."" ??Ultimately, the companies will have to honor the subpoenas, he said. ""I'm going to pit bull them,"" he said. ""This is one we win."" ??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of California's flawed electricity deregulation plan. ??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking court action of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be shared with other public agencies or its competitors. ??Last week, Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the attorney general's obligation to keep proprietary information confidential. ??""We're glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can,"" said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. "" But we have not received sufficient assurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential."" ??Lockyer called Reliant's court filing ""frivolous"" and ""propagandistic"" and insisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under state law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his investigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from being made public. ??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of confidentiality, Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday. ??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information he's seeking. But based on the investigation so far, he said, ""it's beginning to get interesting."" ??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of information about the power merchants' activities. They include the operation of power plants, trading information that may have been shared by private power suppliers and bidding strategies in the California market.

S. MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS. BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. ??""This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,"" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport. ??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market. ??""This is not a free-enterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite."" ??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting ""market power"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state. ??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state. ??""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong."" ??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering. ??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance. ??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices. ??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it. ??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices. ??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis. ??""We're not withholding capacity--no one is,"" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every molecule."" ??In other developments Thursday: ??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal ""would be a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said. ??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome. ??But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form. ??""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate."" ??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars. ??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply. ??""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,"" Wood said. ??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said. ??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs. ??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts. ??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer. ??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries. ??""It's not a huge amount,"" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, ""but every little bit helps."" ??* ??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. ??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. ??But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. ??""I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,"" Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. "" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing."" ??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. ??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,"" Massey said. ??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. ??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. ??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. ??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. ??""We're close because summer is approaching,"" Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. ??""It's important to me that we address the summer,"" Breathitt said, but said she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday. ??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be ""better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency."" ??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. ??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene ""is putting the whole grid at risk,"" said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. ""We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close."" ??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. ??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. ??""The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,"" Feinstein said. ""What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic."" ??But once again, timing could be a problem. ??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. ??""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" Feinstein said. ""Please please please, President Bush, process your nominees."" ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K512 LENGTH: 696 words HEADLINE: In response to power woes, rating agencies have California on credit watch BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. ??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could spell broader risk for the state's budget. ??The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. ??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March, to $73 million a day. ??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. ??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. ??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. ??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. ??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be spent. ??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for it. ??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ??""With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization,"" Cohen said. ""It signals to me that it could delay the financing process."" ??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected. ??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ??""It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high tech area,"" Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. ??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. ??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon. ??""It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does remain very strong,"" he said. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K520 LENGTH: 1069 words HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. ??Now, much of that is up in the air. ??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. ??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into bankruptcy court. ??""Little details are moving billions of dollars around,"" said Nettie Hoge of consumer advocate group TURN. ??All the proposals assume a ""tiered"" structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. ??Among them: ??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a 3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue $4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. ??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. ??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. ??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take effect immediately. ??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. ??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state. ??Each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates for ""medium"" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ""heavy"" use over 200 percent of that level. ??But that's where the similarities end. ??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. ??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? ??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. ??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's web site. ??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. ??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of just 7.5 percent. ??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. ??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate hike of nearly 30 percent. ??""The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. ??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. ??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. ??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ??""It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,"" Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. ??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. ??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. ??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ????????????????????APRIL 20, 2001, FRIDAY, FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. ???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. ???""We are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""There are a lot of concerns about the valuation."" ???Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. ???""The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,"" Burton said. ???Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. ???""The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,"" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. ""There will be a big effort to try and work something out."" ???Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. ???This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. ???""We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system,"" Bryson said. ???Bankruptcy, he said, ""is absolutely a last resort.

""This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."" ???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. ???""This is a very good deal for the state,"" he said. ""It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible."" ???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. ???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. ???""It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""Edison gets off scot-free."" ???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. ???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. ???""The deal on the table is still salvageable,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors. ??The utility said its board of directors decided to withhold bonuses to all but two key executives because the financial effects of the energy crisis have overshadowed all other aspects of company and individual performance. ??The two executives who did get bonuses earned them for their roles in preserving the viability of the companies during the crisis and for retention purposes, Edison said. ??Ted Craver, senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer at Edison International, was paid $375,000 in 2000 and received a $100,000 bonus.

The previous administration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the president said, 'I'm focused on getting the job done,""' Rove said Wednesday in an Associated Press interview. ??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton, but the style has its critics. ??Some lawmakers, including members of his own party, said Bush could have saved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more lawmakers. ??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in Cincinnati, but ran the risk of looking detached. ??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House about Bush attending the U.S. crew's homecoming to reap the public relations reward for freeing the crew. ??But the president vetoed the idea, according to Rove, who quoted Bush as saying, ""I want it to be about them and I don't want to go through the discombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to show up."" ??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots, a budget battle or an international crisis, but Rove said, ""We intended to have a smaller profile than the previous administration."" ??Bush's ""attitude is that he's not going to be measured by whether or not he gets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress,"" Rove said during the 45-minute interview. ??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office, his hands folded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a Starbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were propped against a chair, still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White House. ??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall, allowing Bush's political strategist of eight years to ""go on vacation whenever I'm on the phone."" ??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the White House legislative agenda, maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and position the president for a re-election bid in 2004. ??Bush narrowly won the White House without California's 54 electoral votes, and Rove said the president could win re-election without the state ""but it's always nicer to carry the Golden State."" ??He said the state's electricity shortage will not hurt Bush's chances in 2004, adding that the administration has done ""virtually everything"" Gov. Gray Davis has requested. ??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough power plants and failing to follow the lead of other states, such as Bush's Texas, to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck. ??""This has got a very human dimension to it,"" Rove said. ""It's one thing to talk about power supplies. It's another thing when you talk about how it affects their jobs, how it's affecting their livelihoods, how it's affecting the safety of their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue and it ought to be a wake up call for the entire country."" ??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on recommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and natural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems, focusing on producing more domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants. ??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures aimed at helping California ease its shortages. ??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from politically competitive states to the White House, where they discuss their districts' needs and, often, gain local media attention. ??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign committees, helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which control of Congress is at stake. ??Rove also said: ??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime soon, allowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. ""You can only put so much into that pipe, and we've stuffed it,"" he said of Bush's crowded legislative agenda. The ""fast track"" authority is key to Bush's plans for a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the focus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City. ??-Americans will support Bush's environmental policies despite criticism of his decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton administration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for political troubles. ""I'm not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it's interesting"" that Clinton waited until the last moment to act. ??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be able to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For residential customers, a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16 percent. ??""This is not a final decision,"" said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP and Idaho Power. ""In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff."" ??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between Idaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, the staff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy electricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it. ??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP, repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to Idaho Power for a profit. ??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could financially cripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open market and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is increased. ??""The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems,"" Beaman said, ""and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well."" ??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees - a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company had achieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before. ??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request. ??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a commission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale electricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at unrealistic levels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates constantly. ??""We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and spirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers,"" Beaman said. ??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a case before them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. ??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended: ??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request, without interest, until answers are available about the company's electricity deals. ??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when the commissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part of the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases that the staff believes will be much more expensive next year. ??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it was an error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned on passing on to ratepayers. ??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation by Idaho Power customers. ??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is substantially over 20 percent. ??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings. ??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh used, 6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2,000 kwh, and 7.48 cents per kwh for use over 2,000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh. ??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task, saying it was warned of the possibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995. ??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during the past decade because with electricity deregulation looming, nobody knew what independent power facilities were being considered.

""It's obviously way higher than $100 million."" ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said. ??""I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world,"" said Carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge, Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??""This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power,"" Frank Wolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However, ""there is no law against me saying, 'I'm not going to sell to you,""' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion, Wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??""Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem,"" said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations ""are wasting everybody's time,"" Smutny-Jones said, adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??""People have been playing by the rules,"" Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, federal, academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns, Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??""If the state's offering a $50 million reward, they haven't found anything,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here."" ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: ""I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on."" ??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??""There clearly are market forces at work, that's evident,"" Campbell said. ""Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen conclusive evidence that leads me to make that jump."" LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001",important
56886,2001-04-20 15:33:00,Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20,"""Julee Malinowski-Ball"" <jmball@ns.net>",dasovich-j,"Date: 4/20/01 To: Jan Smutny-Jones, Steven Kelly, Katie Kaplan Cc: IEP Board of Directors From: Julee Malinowski-Ball, Edson + Modisette RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20 RECENT EVENTS: -- IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos= t of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB 28x. SB 28x (Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall, two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the following IEP-sponsored proposals: ? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements ? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE= C ? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites ? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project. ? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review. ? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process, IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals still on the table include: ? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance ? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies ? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. ? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good= news. The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can= . Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm= ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x (Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 --- --- ----------------------- Price Controls Spark Deja Vu=20 Energy: The specter of Richard Nixon's actions 30 years ago hangs over=20 current debate on how to check the state's surging power costs.=20 By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be= =20 adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are= =20 bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills. ?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20 economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in= =20 dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la= st=20 two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20 railroads to energy. ?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20 controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe= rs=20 as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics= =20 who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters= =20 worse for consumers. ?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use= =20 temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20 prices. ?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20 widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing= =20 shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts. ?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke= t=20 had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20 electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh= t,=20 something had to be done. ?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20 controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20 state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste= in=20 (D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo= se=20 price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states. ?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith= =20 stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also= =20 argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating= =20 power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls. ?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe= =20 that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G= OP=20 co-sponsor of the legislation. ?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi= ch=20 regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20 price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the= =20 price of electricity to the cost of producing it. ?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20 proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly= =20 stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20 administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the= =20 record as adamantly opposing price caps. ?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20 maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet= ,=20 ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica= n=20 president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20 level: Richard M. Nixon. ?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try= =20 to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20 dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in= =20 some cases, endorse setting limits on prices. ?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,= =20 chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas= . ?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when= =20 prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20 commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home. ?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete= d=20 at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la= w,=20 either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor= p.=20 and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise= =20 steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later. ?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were= =20 once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have= =20 been deregulated. ?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll= ed=20 for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la= w=20 has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled= =20 utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan= t=20 price controls on electricity until the crisis eases. ?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon. ?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan ?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon= =20 put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said= =20 Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,= =20 which oversees most of the state's electricity grid. ?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20 really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20 prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.= =20 Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,= =20 but I don't think it's ideal."" ?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20 either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe= nt=20 controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly= =20 pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote. ?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private= =20 sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level= =20 White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro= ls. ?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak= e.=20 But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20 prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock= =20 value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation. ?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the= =20 gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting = it=20 float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t= he=20 base upon which today's global financial markets operate. ?????Others disagree. ?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20 worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for= =20 Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York. ?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved= =20 because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20 output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar= =20 anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20 controls were in place, Goldberg added. ?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a= =20 couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas= =20 lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga= n. ?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl= y=20 cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr= ee=20 market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20 artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more= =20 power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend. ?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20 certain items seem to be spiraling out of control. ?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems ?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s= =20 included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro= m=20 the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire= =20 proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal= =20 controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t= he=20 cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20 Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20 subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted. ?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi= ze=20 that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or= =20 other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high. ?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply= =20 and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori= o,=20 who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer= =20 group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye= rs=20 refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20 option for people when it comes to electricity."" ?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20 controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to= =20 other states. That ""actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20 California] by driving imports out of the state,"" the Bay Area Economic=20 Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies= ,=20 said in a report last week. ?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to= =20 keep enough electricity in the state. ?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the= =20 Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are= =20 ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20 controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the= ir=20 expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at ""just and= =20 reasonable"" prices set by the federal agency, he said. ?????That would ""send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th= e=20 state,"" Wolak said. ?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20 power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'= t=20 unlike a natural disaster in which ""normal public service is disrupted"" and= =20 short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said. ?????""Over time, market forces will work"" and controls shouldn't be need, h= e=20 said.

""Ther= e=20 is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20 their lights on,"" he said. ?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the= =20 risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old. ?????""There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei= ng=20 their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer,"" said Dr. Henry Gong,= =20 professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti= on. ?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9= 95=20 pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the= =20 old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said. ?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than= =20 doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the= =20 South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted= a=20 total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month= s=20 of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year. ?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale= =20 may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved= =20 state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20 around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,= =20 hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20 demand because they are inefficient and costly. ?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20 Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant.

But they also will= =20 contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they= =20 will be forced to breathe. ?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th= e=20 900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20 pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of= =20 the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20 pollution-control devices that reduce emissions. ?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20 inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city= =20 pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city= =20 officials say, with more retrofitting. ?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20 estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20 future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi= le=20 asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions. ?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser= ve=20 50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,= =20 2002, or when the energy emergency ends. ?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD= =20 caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four= =20 power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not= =20 produce any more nitrogen oxide, which in sunlight and heat form ozone, sai= d=20 Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning. ?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said. ?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks. ?????""We realize we have a problem this summer.

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 --- --- ---------- Power Plant Plan Worries Neighbors=20 Energy crisis: Regulators will decide next week whether to allow Huntington= =20 Beach facility to boost output. Noise and pollution are concerns.=20 By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with= =20 their two very different neighbors. They live steps from the Pacific Ocean= =20 but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES= =20 Corp. power plant. ?????But California's power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the=20 neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows. ?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to= =20 double the plant's operations by July, providing much-needed electricity bu= t=20 taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them. ?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in= =20 the wake of the power crisis using a ""fast track"" process that allows the= =20 projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20 completed. ?????""The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in= =20 ways we won't know about until 10 years from now,"" said Janette Mortimer, w= ho=20 lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes=20 closest to the plant. ?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20 There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume= s=20 of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem= s=20 never to go away. ?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the= =20 facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials= =20 said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran = it=20 at 30% of capacity. ?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a ""peaker""= =20 unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen= =20 often this summer. The ""peaker"" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20 engines--and sounds like it. ?????Currently, only two boilers are operating. ?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and= =20 the water they swim in. ?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t= he=20 state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to = be=20 studied. ?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of= =20 Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo= ng=20 with other factors, played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that = is=20 discharged miles offshore back toward the coast. ?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20 research won't be complete for some time. ?????""So much is uncertain,"" said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20 Dettloff. ""These are big, big things."" ?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20 disruption. ?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20 construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July. ?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope= n=20 their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and= =20 smells from the plants may make that impossible. ?????""It's going to be bad. There's no escape,"" said Bryan Visnoski. ?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4= 0=20 years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a= nd=20 surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor. ?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others= =20 have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall= =20 trees and trained vines past the windows. ?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis. ?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20 AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20 deregulation. ?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant= =20 since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck. ?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov. Gray Dav= is=20 signed an executive order allowing ""peaker plants"" to operate at extended= =20 hours. ""Peaker plants"" can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle= =20 large amounts of natural gas and are noisy. ?????Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou= d=20 jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport. ?????Whenever the peaker plant goes on, residents call the Air Quality=20 Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke. The=20 inspections have not detected any violations. ?????The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to=20 double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from 500 megawatts to 1,0= 00=20 megawatts. ?????The company's two 40-year-old units represent about 10% of the 5,000= =20 additional megawatts Davis has promised to meet an expected energy shortfal= l=20 this summer. ?????Despite the fast-tracking process, the company has vowed that it would= =20 safeguard against environmental damage and remedy any problems from plant= =20 operations. ?????If the plant is identified as drawing bacteria back to shore, AES woul= d=20 have to pay the costs deemed necessary to fix problems. ?????This is little consolation to residents, who would prefer a full=20 environmental review.

Gray Davis on energy issues=20 Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20 subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power= =20 plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20 Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther= n=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to= =20 rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20 bankruptcy.=20 Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20 Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20 electricity problems?=20 Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available= =20 and the other is the price of power.=20 In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,= =20 we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20 Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20 leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never= =20 change until we have more power than we need.=20 OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]= =20 price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20 In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly= =20 $7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be= =20 this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20 Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do= a=20 thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20 consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20 The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I= t=20 is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an= d=20 able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t= o=20 the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s= ay=20 to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.= =20 We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20 I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow= ns=20 committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the= y=20 could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr= om=20 the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive= ry=20 systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental= =20 property around all their hydro facilities.=20 Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin= g=20 in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20 Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power= =20 entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business= .=20 In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20 power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20 itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but= =20 do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there= by=20 reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless= =20 them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them= =20 ourselves.=20 Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market= =20 prices will come down dramatically.=20 Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem = in=20 20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be= =20 raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20 Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20 solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20 increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20 efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The= y=20 are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20 increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20 Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o= r=20 at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a= =20 blackout?=20 Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20 devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20 accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20 I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going = to=20 say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way = to=20 keep the lights on.=20 Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha= t=20 companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i= n=20 coming years?=20 Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to= =20 market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20 purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will= =20 probably be in less than two months.=20 Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio= n.=20 I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg= e=20 I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20 Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe= r=20 crisis. Is that right?=20 Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20 reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20 At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I= =20 think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i= s=20 reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th= at=20 I proposed.=20 Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay= =20 the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20 Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20 relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out = of=20 the general fund.=20 Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20 Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa= nt=20 to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20 disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological= =20 productivity.

""The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. ""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."" ""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said. An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith. Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution: 1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition. As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators. 2. Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed, but California's political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis. 3. Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth. 4. Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California; increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona, contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets. 5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets. 6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy. 7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants -- suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve. 8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability. Industry Executives' Response Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully, expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the changing environment: -- Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California's current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. -- National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation. -- Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them. -- Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring. -- Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort. Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz: -- Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk limits and communications are in place. -- Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures -- Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions. -- Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies -- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier. -- Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices. -- Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans. -- Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address employees' concerns with information about the company's future and theirs'. Industry/Regulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain: -- Simplify market design. -- Build a continuing role for regulators. -- Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests. -- Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions. -- Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition. -- Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development. -- Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.

The first warm spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10 degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000 megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or alternative energy suppliers are not operating. The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips -- such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at 78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site www.caiso.com. New Notification System: With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to keep current if rotating blackouts are issued. Navigation: Visit www.caiso.com Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to bottom of page and click on Notice Log The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one email address per newsroom. Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after hours. News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms (in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at 888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or level of requests from media.

She characterized the RTO filing requirement as ""bizarre"". It appears to me that it is typical FERC behavior; FERC likes to use whatever leverage it has to force compliance. April 27, 2001 Plan on California Energy Has No Shortage of Critics By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON, April 26 * A novel plan by federal regulators to control California's runaway electricity prices is a messy, politically motivated compromise that may offer some relief to consumers but will do little to fix the state's dysfunctional energy market, analysts said today. The intervention, announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday night after much haggling, was dismissed by a wide range of critics today as a flawed effort that satisfies no one. It fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation that California officials and some energy experts had advocated. But it also crossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders, including President Bush, by imposing price controls on some electricity sales to utilities. Under the agency's order, which takes effect on May 1, California regulators can begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity supplies fall to within 7.5 percent of consumer demand. The state is expected to face such shortages routinely this summer, and the order has the potential to shave billions of dollars off California's electricity bill if implemented fully, some people at the federal agency say. ""The president has a long-held belief that price caps don't work,"" the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said today. ""The last thing you want to do is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm the availability of supply."" Mr. Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal agency, adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand its orders. But Mr. Bush did appoint the commission's chairman, Curtis L. H,bert Jr., a Republican. Like the president, Mr. H,bert has often insisted that price caps do no good. But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the agency's largely hands- off approach to the California crisis. Some of that pressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency, both Democrats, and Mr. H,bert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night. The split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether the president will seek to replace Mr. H,bert as chairman in coming weeks. Mr. Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the commission, including Pat Wood, a longtime ally of the president who served as chief electricity regulator in Texas. Industry executives say they expect that Mr. Bush will eventually name Mr. Wood to the commission's top post. In a reflection of how delicate the issue is, Mr. H,bert argued that the agency's action did not amount to imposing price caps. But his position appeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost- based electricity regulation (as some Californians favor) and the agency's decision to impose tactical price controls. Among California officials, the dominant reaction was disappointment. Some state regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing upside-down economics: it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of severe scarcity, when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage companies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity. The agency, its critics argue, has chosen to ignore price abuses during times of relative abundance, when power generators, the critics say, have used artificial market power to earn high profits. ""They got it exactly wrong,"" said Frank Wolak, chief market supervisor for the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid. ""It looks like they're doing something, but it doesn't work in real time."" Mr. Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year * in amounts that he puts in the billions of dollars * occurred when electricity supplies were not acutely short, meaning that the agency's price caps would have had no mitigating effect. The state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer. But, Mr. Wolak said, generating companies have become adept at ""gaming"" the system. He predicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in California. One fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to affiliates out of state. When California's transmission grid managers scramble to find supplies, the same companies will offer to sell the power back to the state, but only above the cap price. The agency's new order includes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse, known as megawatt laundering. But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such mandates, and California officials are skeptical. The order also came under fire on other grounds. The commission said that price caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link its transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region, a priority of the agency that state officials have resisted. Linda Stuntz, an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the agency, called that clause bizarre, arguing that it held the entire California market hostage to a technical filing requirement. California politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were carried out as promised, relief would be too limited. The price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of the least efficient generating plant in the state. The order as written means that companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell power at large mark-ups during periods when caps are imposed. When the agency scrutinized the California market earlier this year, it found the high-cost generators to be justified in charging about $300 a megawatt hour for electricity, a price that is about 10 times as high as the state was paying for power a year ago.

The public debate and policy=20 discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal= =20 problem amenable to regulatory solution.? However, design of effective=20 policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the=20 diagnosis of the underlying causes.? High prices attributable largely to an= =20 exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular= =20 market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory=20 action.? By contrast, high prices attributable to bad electricity market=20 design would indicate a need for changes in the design.? High prices=20 attributable to higher fuel prices, environmental constraints and capacity= =20 shortages, on the other hand, would prompt actions to address the cost of= =20 fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should=20 receive the appropriate price signal for conservation. Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some=20 capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market.? B= ut=20 charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as=20 exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply.?=20 Likewise, refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke= t=20 power.? Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers, t= he=20 focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal=20 generators in California. On its face, the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the=20 exercise of market power could be important.? But at the same time the data= =20 show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th= at=20 the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than= =20 demand has grown.? If anything, thermal generators that hit annual output= =20 limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000.?=20 Furthermore, the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout= =20 the western market, both on and off peak,? indicate that if the exercise of= =20 market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels= =20 unprecedented in this or other electricity markets.? In short, this is a=20 complicated story, and there is ample room for further investigation of the= =20 data and diagnosis of causes. Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals= =20 that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of=20 electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the=20 simplifying assumptions.? If strategic withholding were large and pervasive= ,=20 then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored= .?=20 But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear, and any finding o= f=20 the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the=20 California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use= d=20 in the analysis of the data.? For example, annual limits on production=20 dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha= n=20 direct incremental costs; hence, examinations of output decisions for=20 individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete.? The variation in re= al=20 time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output= =20 compared to the expectations given day-ahead prices; hence, with capacity= =20 constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal=20 production at average prices.? Limits on the ramping rate of generation=20 units, start-up costs, minimum load costs and other operational=20 inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twenty-four separate= =20 hours and must be analyzed chronologically, recognizing these factors.? And= =20 so on.? Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the=20 previous evidence.? Unfortunately, the real details are neither simple nor= =20 incidental. It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly= =20 available data.? A fuller analysis would require data available only to the= =20 California Independent System Operator, and has not been done.? Many factor= s=20 contributed to higher electricity prices in California, and the market powe= r=20 theme is only, at most, part of the story.? The import of the previous=20 analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the=20 California electricity market but, rather, to suggest that it might be=20 important.? The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha= t=20 market power has not been exercised in the electricity market? but, rather,= =20 to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b= e=20 significant.? With the available data in the public domain, and the special= =20 complications introduced by the California market design, the margin of err= or=20 in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through= =20 strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of=20 magnitude as the effect being measured.? On balance, to date the publicly= =20 available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory=20 Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic= =20 withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred. By contrast, there is general agreement that the California electricity=20 market design is =01&seriously flawed.=018? Furthermore, there is evidence = that the=20 policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an= =20 already serious market collapse.? Hence, without dismissing the possibility= =20 of the exercise of market power, the principal policy focus should be on=20 fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market= =20 design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown.

Although not a panacea, these steps would address immediate=20 problems and set the stage for longer-term initiatives to expand generation= =20 capacity, transmission infrastructure, and the reach of an efficient market= =20 to the western interconnected grid.

The horrible year for California began last May when electricity prices suddenly began to soar, triggering a debate about the cause of the mysterious price increase that is likely to continue for years. It started when a three-day heat wave, from May 21 to May 24, set records in some areas of the state and drove up the demand for electricity as Californians sought relief with air conditioning. More record heat June 14 in the San Francisco Bay Area strained the overloaded system of Pacific Gas & Electric and resulted in rolling blackouts, the planned temporary power outages that some fear may be routine this summer. The average price of electricity on the now-defunct Power Exchange soared to $120 per megawatt hour in June, five times higher than the same month the previous year, and remained roughly at that level until skyrocketing to $377 in December. San Diego sounded the statewide alarm last summer as San Diego Gas & Electric, the first utility to be deregulated, passed along much of the higher cost of electricity to its customers, until legislation rolled back and capped the utility's rates in September. The executive director of a San Diego consumers group, the Utility Consumers' Action Network, thinks the generators and the marketers of power, using sophisticated computer methods, learned something as the heat wave drove up the demand for power. ""It was the first time the generators had an opportunity to see how high the price could go,"" said UCAN'S Michael Shames. ""It was their primer. It was Gouge 101."" State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who chaired a two-house committee that completed the deregulation plan in 1996, had seen routine monitoring data suggesting that the power market was being manipulated to drive up prices. Peace took the unusual step last June of personally urging the adoption of a much lower price cap by the board of the agency that makes last-minute power purchases to maintain the grid, the Independent System Operator. But the motion failed by a single vote. The consumer representative who cast the decisive vote against the lower cap resigned afterward with a blast at Peace, complaining of heavy-handed pressure. Peace is unapologetic. He believes that stronger action by the ISO last June would have sent a signal that might have discouraged market manipulation. ""It's just like the Federal Reserve mis-timing an interest-rate move,"" Peace said. The former ISO chairman, who represents generators, cited an ISO report attributing the price increase last May to the heat wave, power plant outages, less hydroelectric power and higher prices for the natural gas used by power plants. ""I think all of those things showing up at the same time resulted in significantly higher prices,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers. Why power prices remained at high levels and even soared last winter, instead of dropping as usual, is more difficult to explain. The ISO contended last month that generators overcharged by more than $6 billion from last May through February. But federal regulators, who have their critics, have found only $125 million in overcharges, making it an ""annus marvelous"" for generators. Ed Mendel is Capitol bureau chief for the Union-Tribune.

Updated: Monday, April 30, 2001 12:40 AM?ET ????? ? Such a surcharge, at least in the short run, would fall hardest on the state of California, which since January has spent more than $5 billion buying power because the utilities have been unable to meet their obligations. For now, the idea is nothing more than a proposal that occupies one paragraph buried in a 39-page order issued Thursday concerning changes to California's flawed deregulated electricity market. The commission is seeking public comment on the surcharge proposal for 30 days. After that, it will decide whether to implement it. The fee was proposed by Commission Chairman Curt Hebert, a Mississippi Republican, as a way ""to stabilize the market,"" he said Friday, ""since part of the problem in California has to do with nonpayment of bills by the utilities."" But the provision also has the potential to funnel billions of dollars to energy suppliers at a time when those payments are the subject of intense negotiation. One of the utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG, news, msgs), filed for protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy law on April 6, hoping to settle its claims with power suppliers for something less than face value. Representatives of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) Southern California Edison declined to comment on the FERC proposal Friday. The surcharge idea faces stiff opposition from some state officials, one of whom said it amounts to an ""unwarranted intrusion"" into state jurisdiction. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said imposition of a surcharge would put pressure on wholesale-power costs that already are too high. Bulk power cost $7 billion in California in 1999 and topped $27 billion last year as prices careened out of control. Ms. Lynch said she opposes the surcharge provision and the entire order given Thursday, but that it will be up to the full commission to decide how -- or whether -- to file a challenge at FERC. A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said ""the governor would be strongly opposed to any attempt to siphon money away from the state"" and expects to lodge an objection. Los Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 30, 2001, Monday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 792 words HEADLINE: CAPITOL JOURNAL; CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; How Sales Tax Is Falling Through a Loophole BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Dot-coms are in distress and laying off. Silicon Valley is a home buyer's bazaar. The Nasdaq is nauseous. So is this any time to be siccing the tax collector on Internet retailers? ??You bet. Coddling these techie traders with tax favors doesn't seem to be helping them much anyway. So why not treat e-tailers like everyone else, like brick-and-mortar merchants? Treat everybody evenhandedly. ??That's the view of Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), assertive chair of the Assembly Appropriations Committee. For the second straight year, Migden is pushing a bill she says will close a loophole that benefits some Internet retailers. She insists it's about fairly enforcing existing law, not about a new Web tax, as critics claim. ??Present law requires Internet e-tailers to collect the sales tax if they have a physical presence in California, such as a traditional brick-and-mortar store. But some big outfits have created separate out-of-state subsidiaries to handle their Internet orders. Same goods, same ads--with a large tax loophole because the subsidiary ostensibly does not have a physical presence in California. ??Never mind that an unsatisfied customer of bookseller Barnes & Noble dot-com, for example, can return the Internet purchase to the local Barnes & Noble store. ??Many e-tailers with dual ""bricks-and-clicks"" operations do collect the sales tax from Internet customers. Migden cites Macy's, Wal-Mart, REI, Hewlett-Packard and Eddie Bauer. Others refuse, she says: Barnes & Noble, Borders Books, KB Toys, Gateway Computers, Radio Shack. ??Her bill simply ""clarifies"" that the sales tax applies when the e-tailer is affiliated with a California business, sells identical products, and they market jointly. ??""Right now,"" Migden contends, ""certain big businesses blatantly violate the tax law and put hard-working, honest small business people at a disadvantage."" ??* ??Gov. Gray Davis is miffed at Migden, she hears. He vetoed her bill last year, declaring ""it would send the wrong signal about California's international role as the incubator of the dot-com community."" Internet marketing ""must be given time to mature,"" he maintained. ??Now Migden's at it again. ""The governor's exercised. He thinks I'm jamming him,"" she says. ""But I'm moving the bill. He can veto it if he wants. I'm putting it on his desk."" ??It already has cleared the Assembly tax committee and will shoot out of her panel Wednesday, headed for the Assembly floor. Last year, Democrats backed the bill. Republicans opposed it, siding with the Democratic governor. ??Davis fears some future opponent will claim he signed a bill to tax the Internet. Migden is frustrated by that Internet tax tag, calling it ""a lazy misinterpretation."" ??""I'm not picking on e-commerce,"" she protests. ""I'm picking on the multinationals who are arrogantly evading the law in complicity with the state Board of Equalization."" ??That would be, in particular, Republican board member Dean Andal of Stockton. ""It's the usual liberal nut case bill,"" Andal says. ""Just a bill chasing no problem."" ??* ??The BOE administers the sales tax. And Andal does agree that if an Internet purchase can be returned to a store, the e-tailer legally must collect the tax. ""We've been looking into that,"" he says. ??The board shouldn't have to look far. Barnes & Noble tells e-customers right on its Web site that ""you can return purchases to ANY Barnes & Noble store for in-store credit."" ??But other than that, Andal contends, a company has a constitutional right to create an out-of-state subsidiary to avoid taxes. ??And, he notes, we're talking about relative pennies: $ 17 million annually, the BOE estimates, compared to $ 39 billion in total California sales tax collections. That lost revenue would cover only about seven hours worth of electricity the state now is buying for utilities. ??But e-tailing is bound to grow. Tax avoidance could become significant, benefiting dot-coms while discriminating against small retailers and the poor who cannot afford Internet access. ??Migden will be in a strong position to change sales tax policy if she wins her race next year for the five-member BOE. She's the early front-runner. ??Her concern--her reverence--is for the local booksellers, the mom-and-pop merchants, the neighbor shopkeepers who can be smothered by the big tax evaders. ""The little guy with the books stacked in the back,"" she says, ""sweeping the sidewalk, putting on extra locks, obeying the law and collecting taxes--trying to make a go."" ??Davis wants to be seen as a futuristic, New Age pol, worthy of campaign donations from wealthy Web masters. But he can manage that without tromping on his Democratic roots as protector of the little guy.

BYLINE: TIM REITERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??It reads like a phone book: Able Auto Body, Able Building Maintenance, Able Fence Co., Able Printing, Able Termite & Pest Control. . . . ??These companies are among about 50,000 entries on Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s roster of creditors recently filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. ??Another company, A&J Electrical Cable Corp. of Hayward, has supplied PG&E with utility cables since 1980. But now the unpaid bills are hitting the $ 100,000 mark--and that is a big deal to a relatively small business. ??""Who would ever think that PG&E would be in bankruptcy?"" said owner Magdalene Reilly. ""This is something affecting people. I've got a lot of paychecks on Friday. ??""We have orders for the rest of the year from PG&E ,"" she added. ""It is a question: Do you decide to ship? . . . We probably will. They are a good customer."" ??When PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors April 6, businesses from California to Canada were caught by surprise. The names of the 20 biggest creditors, some with billion-dollar claims, were filed with the court. The utility also submitted a list of potential creditors--more than 3,500 pages worth. ??The roster speaks to the remarkable economic clout and reach of a company that prospered for almost a century before plunging into the third-biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. It provides a glimpse into the relationships between a giant utility--the state's largest--and businesses of all sorts and sizes. And it underscores the high stakes as a bankruptcy judge reorders PG&E's financial affairs and decides in the coming months, if not years, who should be paid and how much. ??The case, said U.S. bankruptcy trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley, ""has a ripple effect. . . . Creditors are affected, and they can't pay their bills either."" ??There are small companies and conglomerates that sold power to PG&E. ??There are financial institutions from Wall Street to San Francisco's Montgomery Street that lent money or provided services. ??There are government agencies at all levels, even the California Public Utilities Commission. ??There are some retired PG&E employees and officers, including at least one of the company's former chief executive officers. ??But there also are vendors that have provided goods and services to PG&E for years: tree trimming around power lines, bodywork for the utility's truck fleet, fencing for its vast land holdings, calibration of meters, fans to cool electrical transformers, printing of brochures, signs for office doors, flight suits for aviators who patrol power lines, limousine service for traveling executives. ??No dollar amounts are attached to names on the master list. But records and interviews with dozens of creditors show that the sums owed range from hundreds of millions of dollars to very little--or nothing at all. Many of the smaller creditors were unaware they were on the roster until contacted by The Times. ??PG&E used to buy pump filters from California Pump & Supply in Sacramento. ??""We just closed out their account because they owed us $ 29,"" said office manager Lisa Giordano. ""It's a hassle to get anyone over there. I just wrote it off."" ??The utility bought $ 38 worth of plants from Forest Nursery in Los Osos, west of San Luis Obispo. ""It's nothing to go to court about, especially since they paid it,"" said bookkeeper Lori Parsons. ??A wine wholesaler, an ice cream company and a coastal hotel are listed. So is Sing A Long Productions in Burlingame, which supples disc jockeys and karaoke. ??""I am sure we have done business with PG&E and other companies that have parties from time to time,"" said owner Nick Foster. ""Maybe somebody forgot that we did not get paid."" ??PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the list includes everyone to whom the utility wrote a check in the last two years, such as homeowners who received energy conservation rebates and retirees who received checks related to benefits. ??""It was an attempt to notify anybody who possibly could have a claim against the company and to cast the widest net possible,"" he said. ??Several PG&E retirees, such as Robert W. Oliver of Berkeley, were baffled by their inclusion on the list. ""I draw a little pension,"" said Oliver, who was a personnel executive and left the company in 1980. ""It's a vested pension."" ??Another retiree on the list is former Chief Executive Richard A. Clarke. ??He and about 10 other former high-ranking PG&E executives or their survivors have retained an attorney to help ensure that their retirement benefits are protected during the bankruptcy case. ??""We don't want someone to get the idea that this is a bunch of well-heeled executives trying to get a piece of the action,"" said the attorney, John T. Hansen. ""Some in our group are widows of former executives who depend on the pensions they receive as survivors."" ??Hansen said some retired executives have deferred-compensation packages that might be considered a general unsecured bankruptcy claim. ??One concern, he said, is that PG&E Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. wrote recently in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed article that health care plans and other benefits ""for employees and most retirees"" will continue. ??""We would want to know what 'most' is,"" Hansen said. ""We want to sort it out."" ??Low of PG&E said fewer than 100 retired employees, most former officers, ""have a portion of their pension that is unsecured."" That means their claims will be handled in Bankruptcy Court with those of other unsecured creditors whose debts are not backed by utility assets. ??The spokesman emphasized that ex-employees could be on the list because they received a check from the company for something. ??Companies and individuals on the list, PG&E said, will be contacted and given an opportunity to state their claims, which the utility will file with the court May 11. ??Meanwhile, the effects of the bankruptcy filing continue to ripple beyond the utility. ??PG&E's action hit AA Safe & Lock Co. in Santa Cruz particularly hard. The firm replaces keys and locks for PG&E offices and trucks. ??""We are a small business, and it is a big account,"" said owner Paul Bing, who declined to say what the utility owes. ""We haven't been doing as much for them since the whole crisis started."" ??A Hayward firm that conducts environmental testing when PG&E remodels or razes buildings is out money too. Ken Byk, president of Forensic Analytical, would not provide a figure but said: ""I am obviously concerned. . . . They are a good customer, but any time you run into these problems, it's disappointing."" ??California Steam Inc. of Sacramento services PG&E pressure washers and water recyclers at its truck-cleaning facilities. ""I have just a couple of invoices out,"" said service manager Bruce Amlin. The debt, he said, is less than $ 500. ??A similar amount is owed to California Turbo Inc. in Ontario. Sales manager Cam Young said the utility has not paid for eight fans used to cool electrical transformers. ""We're a small business,"" Young said, adding with a laugh: ""We might have to eat peanut butter and jelly for four or five months."" ??Within days of the bankruptcy filing, PG&E sent about 12,000 creditors letters that began: ""Valued Goods and Services Provider: . . . Unfortunately, the bankruptcy code precludes payment for goods and services received prior to the date of filing. Payments on this pre-petition debt will be settled as part of the plan of reorganization."" The company assured vendors that they will be paid for any future purchases. ??Some are not only forgiving, they are outspokenly loyal to PG&E. ??The relationship between the utility and AG Signs of Stockton spans two decades. When Tony Guebara was starting his company, PG&E gave him business. ""They try to help the little guy,"" he said. ""Just about everybody in town is a vendor. They have people here who paint their trucks."" ??AG Signs now has five employees and supplies PG&E with door lettering for trucks, name plaques for office doors and signs and flags for construction sites. ??Guebara said the utility's debt does not worry him: ""PG&E has treated me real well. If I lose a couple of bucks because of this adversity, that is OK. . . . I don't think we've seen the last of PG&E."" ??Many businesses and individuals said they had no idea why the company believes it owes them money. ??Being included on the creditors list left the Vallejo Camp Fire Girls & Boys and other charitable organizations somewhat confused. Officials of one Berkeley church could only speculate that it was listed because PG&E stock was bequeathed to the congregation decades ago. ??Twylah Lemargie, manager of the Cancer Aid Thrift Shop in Grass Valley, said the utility is not even a customer. ""PG&E did come in and replaced lots of our ceiling lights with the long tubes,"" she said. ""But it was done free as an energy saver."" ??A number of vendors said PG&E's account is paid up. ??The utility rented temporary housing units for workers on a hydroelectric project about two years ago, but California RV Rentals in Rio Lindo is still named as a creditor. ""They don't owe me money,"" said Sandra Weaver, the manager. ""If they want to give me some, it's OK."" ??Many creditors are health clubs and health care providers: medical and dental offices, foot and joint specialists, pharmacies, chiropractors. ??When informed that the Castro Valley Chamber of Commerce was on the creditors list, the woman who answered the phone laughed uproariously. Then Executive Director Bonnie Dettmer came to the line. ??""I'm going to guess it's membership dues,"" she said. ""They are a member and they have been very supportive. I would bet they belong to every chamber of commerce."" ??One creditor is the state agency that PG&E says drove the company into insolvency by not allowing full recovery of its wholesale power costs. ??""They owe us $ 5.9 million . . . for environmental impact reports on PG&E projects,"" said Paul Clanon, director of the Public Utilities Commission's energy division. ""It's a serious amount of money but currently is not having an impact."" ??Top 10 Creditors ??The creditors owed the most money by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., according to the company's Chapter 11 filing: ???Creditor owed ???Bank of New York ????????????????????????$2.20 billion ???California Power Exchange ???????????????$1.96 billion ???Bankers Trust Co. ???????????????????????$1.30 billion ???California Independent System Operator ??$1.12 billion ???Bank of America* ?????????????????????????$938 million ???US Bank million ???Calpine Gilroy Cogeneration LP ????????????$58 million ???Calpine Greenleaf Inc. ????????????????????$49 million ???Crocket Cogen million ???Calpine King City Cogen LLC ???????????????$45 million ??* Heading a group of banks ??Source: U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern DIstrict of California GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: Top 10 Creditors, Los Angeles Times PHOTO: Magdalene Reilly, owner of A&J Electrical Cable Corp. of Hayward, says her company has supplied Pacific Gas & Electric with utility cables since 1980, and that their unpaid bills are now hitting the $100,000 mark. ?PHOTOGRAPHER: ROBERT DURELL / Los Angeles Times PHOTO: ""They try to help the little guy,"" says Tony Guebara, owner of AG Signs in Stockton, of PG&E.

DAVIS' PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR FACES DEMANDS FOR BILLIONS AS A RESERVE AND TO CUSHION ELECTRICITY RATE HIKES. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Jockeying over the state's next spending plan, a tradition that usually takes place in the summer, already is turning intense as the energy crisis casts a pall over what otherwise might have been relatively painless budget squabbles. ??A key state senator, worried about the slowing economy, is looking for places to pare as much as $ 4 billion from Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $ 104.7-billion budget. And Republicans are beginning to demand that the state spend billions in general tax money to cushion electricity rate hikes of up to 40% being imposed on consumers and businesses. ??Davis won't sign the budget for the 2001-02 fiscal year into law until late June at the earliest. But with California mired in the energy crisis and the economy slowing, the new budget is shaping up to be especially vexing. ??California's largest utility and a major private employer, Pacific Gas & Electric, is in bankruptcy. The state has spent $ 5.2 billion in general tax money to buy electricity, with no end in sight. Even before summer temperatures hit, Sacramento shelled out $ 90 million to buy electricity in a single day last week. ??And the Wall Street rating firm Standard & Poor's, unsure that the state will be reimbursed for the power purchases, lowered California's credit rating two notches for the first time since the recession of the 1990s. ??Brightening an otherwise cloudy situation, income tax payments are meeting or exceeding predictions. More than $ 8 billion in checks from April income tax returns have flooded into the Franchise Tax Board, said Department of Finance economist Ted Gibson. On one day last week, the state's haul was $ 3.6 billion, a record. ??""Receipts are very much on track, I'm relieved to tell you,"" Gibson said. ??But even as budget writers were exhaling, the payments merely offered proof that the economy was strong last year, back when then-President Bill Clinton was heralding the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history, and Californians' lexicon did not include the term ""rolling blackout."" ??State income and sales tax receipts softened in the first few months of 2001, an indication that people will be earning less this year--and paying less in taxes next year. ??Seeing trouble ahead, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) wants to boost the state's emergency reserve, which was $ 1.9 billion in January. To do that, Peace last week called on budget committee members to come up with a list of cuts totaling $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion. ??Without a larger reserve heading into 2002, Peace said, the slowing economy could force the state to make deep cuts or raise taxes next year, at a time when most legislators and Davis will be running for reelection. ??""The thing to be worried about is not the current year, but the trend line,"" Peace said. ??He adds a caveat for the spending plan that by law must be in place by July 1: There will be cuts if legislators fail to approve legislation that state Treasurer Phil Angelides says he needs to obtain short-term loans and market long-term bonds to finance electricity purchases. ??Davis and Angelides are preparing the largest bond sale--a way that government borrows money--in U.S. history, as much as $ 12.4 billion. The state would use the proceeds to ease the shock to utility customers of record high electricity prices this year. The bond debt would be paid off over a period of perhaps 15 years. ??Given the size and complexity of the bond issue, many legislators say Angelides may not be able to sell it for months. ??Davis, however, has an immediate need for money. The governor must release a revised state budget within weeks. So, he is pushing for legislators to approve legislation that would allow Angelides to obtain a short-term loan of as much as $ 6 billion. ??At least some of the proceeds of the long-term bonds would be used to pay off the short-term loan--sort of like using one credit card to pay the balance on a second piece of plastic. ??Republican legislators are balking at the idea. ??Back in December, before the state entered the power buying business, GOP legislators had called for $ 3.2 billion in tax cuts. With the energy crisis complicating the financial situation, some Republicans are contending that Davis should use as much as $ 5 billion from the budget surplus to soften the impact of electricity rate hikes. ??""That will be a de facto tax cut,"" said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. ""Our Democratic friends want to do the bridge financing so they can increase the size of government."" ??Republicans are in the minority. But they have a significant voice, because state law requires that both houses of the Legislature approve spending decisions by a two-thirds vote. ??The state Constitution says the budget must be in place by the July 1 start of the new fiscal year. Davis signed his first two budgets on time. Given this year's uncertainties, however, some legislators are thinking twice about making July vacation plans. ??The sudden turnaround may come as a shock to many legislators and lobbyists who seek slices of the state budget pie. ??In recent years, legislators have grown used to the multibillion-dollar windfalls of tax payments, which allowed them to deliver new swimming pools, school programs, museums, parks, social and health care spending, and tax cuts to their constituents. Indeed, the budget in Davis' first two years grew 37%, even as the Democratic governor and legislators cut taxes by $ 3.9 billion. ??In a Legislature populated by term-limited newcomers, only a handful of current legislators were in the Capitol in the early 1990s, when the worst recession to hit California since the Great Depression caused the state budget to actually shrink. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature reacted to a $ 14-billion budget gap by raising taxes by more than $ 5 billion and slashing spending. ??""It is not going to be the pie-in-the-sky budget some of us thought it would be last year and even as late as January,"" said Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo). ??Veterans of the annual summer rite say there is no template for the coming budget fights. Jean Ross of the California Budget Project, a private budget watchdog and advocacy group, said Davis and legislators not only must pay attention to the economy. ??They also must take into account many unknowns: Will the judge overseeing PG&E's bankruptcy proceeding seek to raise rates further? Will federal energy regulators be able to effectively limit wholesale electricity costs? What will the economic impact be of summer blackouts? ??""It's a lot more complex and unpredictable than other years,"" Ross said. ??Legislators say they are lowering their sights. But letters from state senators requesting money for their favored projects fill five large red binders. ""You wouldn't know there is a money shortage based on requests in appropriations,"" said Assembly Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), preparing for what she calls her ""hatchet role"" of blocking bills that require spending. ??For his part, Davis has not decided to significantly cut back on his proposals, ranging from a sales tax ""holiday"" timed for back-to-school shopping to plans to clean sewage from beaches. He won't reveal those decisions until he releases his revised spending plan.

BYLINE: FRANK A. WOLAK, Frank A. Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University, is, chairman of the Market Surveillance Committee of the California, Independent System Operator BODY: ??Out-of-state firms selling into the California wholesale electricity market at exorbitant prices have been blamed for the current electricity crisis. They are, claim many observers, exercising their market power to raise wholesale electricity prices. ??Although it is not illegal under California or U.S. antitrust law for a firm to exercise its market power, it is illegal to do so under the Federal Power Act. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, which regulates the California wholesale electricity market, is the entity charged with enforcing this law. Its refusal to take sufficient actions that would result in ""just and reasonable"" wholesale electricity rates is the fundamental cause of California's current energy crisis. It is highly unlikely that anything it has done in the last week has changed things at all. ??In 1935, Congress passed the Federal Power Act and required the Federal Power Commission (the predecessor to FERC) to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale electricity prices. Just and reasonable prices are those that recover production costs, including a ""fair"" rate of return on the capital invested by the firm. Moreover, if the FERC finds that wholesale electricity prices are unjust and unreasonable, the Federal Power Act gives it wide-ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices. The FERC can also order refunds for any payments by consumers in excess of just and reasonable prices. ??Almost 10 years ago, the FERC began to allow generators to receive market prices instead of prices set through a cost-of-service regulatory process. However, there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the Federal Power Act. Markets often set prices substantially in excess of the production costs for significant periods of time. This occurs because one or more firms operating in the market have what economists call market power--the ability of a firm to raise market prices and profit from it. ??However, if no firm possesses market power, the market price should be very close to a price that only recovers production costs. In such a circumstance, the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the Federal Power Act. ??Before it allows any market participant to receive a market price rather than a cost-based price set through a regulatory process, the FERC requires each participant to demonstrate that it does not have market power. In other words, each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the FERC demonstrating it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this behavior. ??Each of the out-of-state generators made these filings before they began selling into the California market, which started in April 1998. Each firm had its authority to receive market prices approved by the FERC for a three-year period that ends before this summer for several of the firms. It is virtually impossible to determine on a prospective basis whether a firm possesses market power. Moreover, the methodology used by the FERC to make this determination uses analytical techniques that have long been acknowledged by the economics profession as grossly inadequate. The events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that contrary to their filings stating otherwise, all of the out-of-state generators possess significant market power. ??A number of independent studies have shown that the market power exercised by these firms has resulted in unjust and unreasonable rates from May 2000, until now. Moreover, in its Dec. 15, 2000 report on the California electricity market, the FERC concluded that wholesale electricity prices during the summer and autumn of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power. ??Despite its own conclusion, the FERC thus far has refused to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in California. Instead, the FERC implemented market rule changes that have enhanced the ability of these firms to set excessive wholesale electricity prices. In addition, it has refused to order refunds for any overpayment during the summer and autumn of 2000 for the prices that it deemed unjust and unreasonable. ??Fortunately for California consumers, the California Public Utilities Commission and Gov. Gray Davis refused to be accomplices in the FERC's decision not to enforce the Federal Power Act. They refused to pass on to California consumers prices that the FERC itself had determined were unjust and unreasonable. ??Because these out-of-state firms must apply for renewal of their market-based pricing authority before this summer, the FERC has one more opportunity to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in California. It has before it several proposals that would enforce all provisions of the Federal Power Act. The health of the California and national economies would be severely undermined if the FERC continues to ignore its legal obligations.

OPPEL Jr. and LAURA M. HOLSON BODY: ??Pacific Gas and Electric, the giant California utility, may have just made one of the largest bankruptcy filings in history, but it has been a banner year for the rest of its parent company, the PG& E Corporation. ??In Bethesda, Md., far from the energy crisis in California, another PG& E subsidiary, National Energy Group, earned $162 million last year and ranked as the nation's third-largest power trader. Compensation for the unit's executives soared. Many investors now believe that the subsidiary, just a decade in the making, is by itself worth more than its 96-year-old utility sibling. ???How did National Energy get so big so fast? By using cash, partly generated by its sister utility, to buy unregulated power plants in the Northeast, expand trading-floor operations and sell power across the country. The exact numbers are in dispute, but much of Nationals Energy's profits last year came from California. ??Most other large utilities have done the same thing over the past decade, building national or even global power companies from roots in local monopolies. But nowhere is the success of these unregulated businesses more of an issue than in California, where PG& E's investments may be challenged in bankruptcy court. ??Still, such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states, and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity. ??And today, the offspring of the nation's utilities dominate that market, after industry leader Enron. ?Eight of the nation's 10 largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities, controlling about 42 percent of power trading. ??It is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in California have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging, and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first, halting steps toward embracing last week. ??The profitability of the utilities' unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year. ??For example, Reliant Energy reported that operating income at its unregulated wholesale energy business soared to $216 million in the first quarter, or 16 percent more than at its regulated utility, which serves Houston. This week, Reliant expects to spin off its unregulated businesses through an initial public stock offering that would put a market value on the new company of as much as $8.8 billion -- more than the rest of Reliant. ??A number of other major utility companies have spinoffs or trading and generation units that now earn nearly as much as, or more than, their core utility operations. These include Duke Energy in Charlotte, N.C.; Sempra Energy of San Diego; the Southern Company in Atlanta; the Constellation Energy Group in Baltimore; and Utilicorp United in Kansas City, Mo. ??In some places, the growth of the unregulated businesses continues to raise questions of fairness -- particularly where utilities have been permitted to transfer plants to the new units at deep discounts to their market value. Critics say that ratepayers, whose bills paid for the plants' construction, should benefit more when the plants are sold. ??In Florida, a commission on energy deregulation formed by Gov. Jeb Bush has proposed permitting such transfers on the grounds that they are needed to create a new wholesale marketplace. Opponents, including the Florida Municipal Electric Association, which represents utilities owned by local governments, say the plan would produce a $9 billion windfall that should go to ratepayers. ??In California, some creditors of Pacific Gas and Electric have signaled that they will want the bankruptcy court in San Francisco to review parent PG& E's efforts to keep its unregulated businesses out of creditors' reach. ??And the California Public Utilities Commission is investigating whether PG& E and Edison International, whose Southern California Edison utility unit is also near insolvency, have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies. ??A recent audit ordered by the commission showed that Pacific Gas and Electric transferred $4.1 billion to PG& E from 1997 to 1999. Most of that went to dividends and stock repurchases, but $838 million was invested in other subsidiaries, primarily its National Energy Group unit. Southern California Edison transferred $4.8 billion to its parent company between 1996 and November 2000, a separate audit showed; Edison International invested $2.5 billion in its unregulated Mission Group subsidiaries during the same period. ??Executives of the companies say the transfers were proper. Audits have shown that ""we followed the rules and didn't do anything wrong,"" said PG& E's chief executive, Robert Glynn. ""We did not ask consumers in California to support any of the losses that occurred in those businesses when we started them up,"" he said. Now, forcing the unregulated units to support their ailing sister utility, he said, ""would be no different than calling up shareholders and saying, 'The California electric bills are pretty high; send some money in so we can give it back to them.' "" ??Loretta Lynch, the president of the utilities commission, took a different view. ""Should we look backward,"" she asked, ""and say, 'Hey, wait a minute -- that corporate structure profited by all of our power payments to them in the past, and they should participate in helping us through to get to a solution in the future?' "" ??The cornerstone deal of PG& E's unregulated energy business was struck four years ago, when it acquired the hydroelectric and fossil-fueled generation plants of New England Electric System for $1.6 billion. PG& E is now one of the largest generators in the Northeast, operating plants that can light up to five million average-sized homes. ??While California officials say Pacific Gas and Electric's woes have been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation by out-of-state generators, the Justice Department has been investigating possible market abuses involving PG& E and two other companies in New England. Mr. Glynn said that PG& E had done nothing wrong and that the company has responded to Justice Department requests for information. ??Overall, PG& E's National Energy Group has 30 power plants in 10 states, and others under development or construction that include one in Athens, N.Y., that is expected to begin supplying electricity to New York City in 2003. It also operates an energy trading operation in Bethesda and controls a natural gas pipeline into Northern California. ??To Wall Street, the utility companies' investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic, as investors demanded faster-growing profits. ??""The stock market was going like gangbusters, and the utilities' returns of 11 percent weren't cutting it,"" said Richard Cortright, a utility analyst at Standard and Poor's, the bond rating agency. ??Moreover, as deregulation loomed, industry executives saw no choice but to make new investments. ""It looked like the utility opportunity was going to start shrinking,"" Mr. Glynn said. ??Consumer groups question whether utilities would have invested more in improving basic service if they had not had the option of putting money elsewhere. ??Mike Florio, a lawyer with The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group in San Francisco, cited findings last year by state regulators that from 1987 to 1995, Pacific Gas & Electric spent nearly $550 million less on maintaining electric and gas facilities than had been factored into its rates. Separately, in 1999, the utility agreed to pay about $29 million to settle charges that consumers were endangered because it failed to trim trees near high-voltage power lines. ??""Several hundred million dollars didn't get spent for maintenance, and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit,"" Mr. Florio said. ??Mr. Glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance, coming within one-half of one percent of the amount built into rates over a 20-year period. ??In the big picture, he said, it was hard to see how PG& E had been a winner in deregulation, even before its utility's humiliating bankruptcy. ""If you look at what happened, the net of it was a loss,"" Mr. Glynn said, ""because the value leaked out on the regulated utility side faster than we were able to build it on the nonregulated side.""

Not that she's complaining. Hoge, 50, honestly loves her job and insists she wouldn't do anything else. ???""I've got a mutant gene,"" she said with a laugh as she relaxed, for just a moment, in a spartan office littered with messy piles of paperwork. ""I've always wanted to do this."" ???TURN has been keeping tabs on companies like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Pacific Bell for more than 25 years. Hoge and her crew lobby the Public Utilities Commission, counsel lawmakers, analyze reports and file the occasional lawsuit. They are, in short, professional gadflies who represent the public in a system that some say favors big business. ???""The biggest protector of the consumer, by far, has been TURN,"" said Bob Gnaizda, public policy director for the Greenlining Institute in San Francisco. ""(Hoge) has made TURN into the leading consumer utility advocate in the nation."" ???It's not glamorous work, nor is it particularly lucrative. Hoge, a lawyer by training, took a pay cut when she accepted the $75,000-a-year job in 1995. And, truth be told, most folks have no idea Hoge is in their corner. ???""There are other rewards,"" she said. ""You don't get the adoration of Joe Citizen standing up and yelling, 'Yay TURN!' But there's an excitement about being involved in the discussions where the big decisions are made."" ???The youngest of four children, Hoge bounced around the middle of the country as she grew up, following her career Army officer father from Kansas to Oklahoma to Texas. ???""All the places where you can shoot big guns,"" she joked. ???Hoge graduated from high school in Pullman, Wash. After a stint at the University of Southern California, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Washington State University and earned a law degree from the University of San Francisco. ???Hoge's entire career has been spent protecting the underdog.

""The partners would come around each month to check our billable hours. Mine were always zero."" ???Since taking the helm almost six years ago, Hoge has led TURN to some impressive consumer victories. They include persuading the Public Utilities Commission to create a $352 million fund to underwrite rural telephone service and bringing an end to ratepayer subsidies of PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in 2002. ???Hoge, a stickler for detail, has a reputation for giving exhaustive answers to even mundane questions. ???""Everybody agrees she knows what she's talking about,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""In many respects, TURN is the intellectual force in this debate.

""Maybe I overcompensate."" ???Few doubt Hoge's smarts, but she has plenty of critics among the utilities, lawmakers and lobbyists she has crossed swords with over the years. However, none of them will say anything publicly. ???""We have no comment on her,"" said Shawn Cooper, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent company of the foundering utility. ???It was the same story with Southern California Edison and many of the legislators who have criticized Hoge and TURN in recent years. ???Hoge isn't surprised her adversaries are keeping mum. ???""There's nothing for them to gain by saying anything negative about us because the public is on our side,"" she said. ???Still, TURN has drawn criticism from Carl Wood, generally considered the most ardent consumer advocate on the PUC. ???""Frankly, I would have expected myself to be on the same page with (TURN) more than I actually am,"" Wood said. ""I'm not sure they wholeheartedly believe in regulation, and I think it comes from a distrust of regulators. But maybe I'm taking it personally."" ???Wood chastised TURN for supporting utility divestiture of generating plants as California's deregulation effort got under way. And he said Hoge places too much emphasis on the utilities' role in the energy mess instead of focusing on the profiteering of power generators. ???""The utilities have some culpability, but they are not the main driver behind the crisis,"" Wood said. ""TURN's interventions do not reflect that reality."" ???Still, he gave TURN high marks and credited Hoge with making it a far more effective advocate. ???Hoge admits she has had her hands full with the energy crisis, saying she and her staff ""are trying to keep our health and sanity."" ???Asked if she would have joined TURN if she had known how crazy California's energy market would become and how hard she would have to work, Hoge was characteristically wary. ???""I don't think anyone would want to sign up for this,"" she said after a moment's pause. ""On the one hand, it's very serious, very rewarding work. But on the other hand, sometimes you're just beating your head against the wall."" ???Still, Hoge doesn't plan to give up the fight anytime soon. ???""But at some point I'd like to retreat and spend some time contemplating the forest for the trees."" ???Or the garden for the plants. ??Nettie Hoge -- Age: 50. ???-- Residence: Oakland. ???-- Job: Executive director, The Utility Reform Network, October 1995 to present.

A03 LENGTH: 1669 words HEADLINE: Energy Forecast for Summer: No Blackouts but Price Spikes; Grid Managers Promote Conservation, Await New Plants BYLINE: William Claiborne, Washington Post Staff Writer DATELINE: CHICAGO BODY: ??The rest of the United States is virtually certain to escape rolling blackouts this summer like the ones that have plagued California, but record price hikes for electricity are likely in many places, energy experts agree. ???Despite their confidence that they can survive everything but an extremely hot summer without power outages, managers of the nation's interconnecting electrical power grids are anxiously awaiting new power plants that are scheduled to come on-line. They are also promoting more frugal consumption by power customers and seeking ways to avoid distribution logjams during peak demand periods this summer. ???""We see a big distinction between California and the rest of the country,"" said David Costello, an economist in charge of short-term forecasting for the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy. ""We have no real reason to believe anyplace is unusually at risk."" ???But record spikes in the price of electricity are a given for this summer, some industry analysts say, because a growing proportion of power plants now run on natural gas, which has doubled in price over the past year. ???The DOE estimates that electricity demand will grow 2.3 percent nationally this year, with much higher increases in the West and the South. At the same time, the reserve capacity margin that utilities try to build into their systems to handle the hottest days -- when use of air conditioners and other appliances taxes supplies -- has been falling in some regions to well less than the desired 15 percent above peak summer loads. ???That means utilities may have to import large volumes of electricity over transmission systems that were not designed to handle them. What power officials are hoping to avoid are critical shortfalls in generating capacity in some regions, followed by overwhelming strains on aging high-voltage transmission lines as power is bought and sold across the country in increasingly competitive electricity markets. ???Even though scores of new power plants have been built in the Northeast, South and Midwest in recent months and many more are on the drawing boards, the expected 15 percent increase in new generation will not be fully on-line for another two years. That leaves parts of the nation vulnerable to outages if there are prolonged heat waves this summer, or if utilities are unable to start up new or rebuilt gas-fired power plants as scheduled, according to energy experts. ???Despite all those potential problems, there is no reason to believe that California's power nightmares will spread to the rest of the country, officials said. ???This year, utilities have announced they are adding 40 to 50 gigawatts of new generating capacity to gas-fired plants across the nation, compared with only 22 gigawatts that were added last year, Costello said. He said that even if half of those announced plants never materialize, this year's new capacity is certain to be as great or greater than last year's, meaning that the predicted increased consumption can probably be met. A gigawatt is 1,000 megawatts, or enough to power about 1 million homes. ???""We don't know that [transmission] infrastructure has really been fixed, but my sense is they're in better shape overall as far as capacity is concerned,"" Costello said. ???The nation's 203,600-mile high-voltage network has undergone relatively few changes in 50 years, during which deregulation has prompted electricity wholesalers to sell power at even greater distances to reach more lucrative markets, adding to the pressure on the grid system. ???California, in a sense, has been serving as a stalking horse for other states, some of which also deregulated their electricity systems and are consciously avoiding doing anything that resembles the California model. ???Eugene Gorzelnik, spokesman for the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), which oversees the interlocking power grids, said: ""Obviously, there will be problems in California and there's nothing that's going on that will solve those problems. But a lot of [utilities] people are looking at California and saying to themselves, 'Can I do this in a way they didn't?' That's a positive development."" ???Apart from California, the worst problems are expected in adjoining western states, as Golden State electrical grid managers scramble to buy electricity at a time when power production at the region's hydroelectric dams is already being cut because of shrinking water levels in reservoirs. ???The Northwest Power Planning Council recently reported that the demand for electricity has grown 24 percent in the past decade while new generation has grown only 4 percent. ???NERC is not expected to issue its long-awaited pre-summer electricity reliability assessment -- a document that forecasts peak generation and consumption -- until next month. But in interviews, officials of many of the 10 regional reliability councils that comprise the national grid system appeared fairly sanguine about the prospect of avoiding widespread brownouts this summer. ???""Assuming normal weather and assuming our generating units come off maintenance on schedule, we don't anticipate any particular problems meeting our loads,"" said Bill Reinke, executive director of the Southeastern Electricity Reliability Council. ???Reinke said the region was adding 300 miles of new transmission lines, has 5,600 megawatts of new generating capacity -- enough to power 5.6 million homes -- and is seeking to identify potential transmission bottlenecks so it can take preemptive corrective measures against distribution failures. ???Outside the West, the greatest potential for blackouts may be in New York, where the near certainty of transmission logjams in an antiquated infrastructure prompted Consolidated Edison Co. to request approval for 11 combustion turbine mini-generators in case of a power shortage. Residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental grounds. ???Stephen Allen, spokesman for the Northeast Power Coordinating Council said, ""If the 400 megawatts the generators provide go on-line, it'll still be tight, but New York should be okay."" He said Upstate New York should have surplus electricity to sell to New York City, although some experts say transmission bottlenecks could make it difficult for New York City to import power on abnormally hot days. ???New York City customers, who have already had their electricity rates increased 40 percent in the last two years, could see prices rise an additional 50 percent because of the deregulated power industry's dependence on gas-fired generation, according to some analysts. ???Allen said that since last June, New England has added mostly gas-fired plants that generate more than 1,000 megawatts and should have an additional 2,000 megawatts on-line before the end of the summer. He said the region should have a 15 percent to 18 percent capacity margin. ???The Mid-Atlantic Area Council, made up of Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, is expecting a reserve margin of more than 16 percent and an increase of 2,100 megawatts in generating capacity over last year, to about 60,000 megawatts, according to the council's president, Phillip G. Harris. Harris said the council met last year's peak of 49,288 megawatts with no problems, though the summer of 2000 was relatively cool. ???Harris cited several reasons ""why we are not like California,"" including a decision to centralize all planning, which California did not; the creation of a regional market instead of a state-based marketplace like California's, and a policy of only slow, incremental changes in the grid. ???""A single misstep can have huge consequences,"" Harris said. ""We're tinkering with something that has worked for 100 years, so you better do it right."" ???In the Midwest, utilities expect a peak demand this summer of 55,221 megawatts, compared with 52,214 megawatts last summer, according to Richard Bulley, executive director of the six-state Mid-America Interconnected Network. But keeping pace with the nearly 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity, Bulley said. ???""We do not anticipate any major limitations on the region's bulk transmission system, and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than 18 percent,"" he said. ???Since 1998, 33 companies have proposed projects in Illinois totaling 25,000 megawatts of gas-fired power. Although no one expects all of that to come on-line, the state's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts, meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated power was added, the region would have a cushion, even in a hot summer. ???Officials of Commonwealth Edison Co., the biggest utility in Illinois, say that new or rebuilt electrical distribution facilities should prevent a repeat of the kind of disastrous power outages that crippled offices in Chicago's Loop last summer, when lines broke and transformers burst into flames. ???Few power grids are in as good shape as Texas's. The state anticipates a 23 percent power margin this summer and the addition of 9,188 megawatts of new generating capacity this year, according to Heather Tindall, spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Texas utilities have 27 new power plants under construction and 31 more in the planning stages, she said. ???As a result, ERCOT is forecasting almost 70,000 megawatts of generating capacity this summer, compared with a peak demand of 57,600 megawatts on one 111-degree day last summer. ???Tindall said that after studying California's system, the Texas grid made a ""concerted effort"" to operate theirs differently. For example, she said, Texas supports utilities entering into long-term contracts for power, while in California, power companies did not enter into such contracts and were forced to pay exorbitant prices at peak times.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is considering requiring the state's electric grid operator to add a surcharge on power sales to pay generators the money they are owed by the state's two large financially strapped utilities. ??- State power buyers have asked for another $500 million to buy electricity for the customers of three cash-strapped utilities. That brings the total amount authorized for power purchases to $6.2 billion since mid-January, when the state began purchases power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??- Gov. Gray Davis says state office buildings cut energy use by an average of 20 percent in January and February, saving taxpayers $286,000 in utility bills. ??- State officials negotiating long-term power contracts for customers of three cash-strapped utilities have secured five more contracts. Four of the contracts signed in March by the Department of Water Resources will provide 466 megawatts of electricity during times of peak demand this summer, according to DWR documents. One megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes. ??- California Public Utilities Commission attorneys are advising state agencies to avoid submitting monetary claims against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. despite the company's bankruptcy. The PUC is trying to retain their electric rate-setting authority over the utility and says submitting claims could bring the state under the court's jurisdiction as a creditor, which could allow the judge to set electric rates. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $9.90, up 15 cents. PG&E Corp. closed at $8.94, up 20 cents. ??-The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates as much as 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

BODY: ???Geothermal plants in The Geysers area north of the Napa Valley have tapped steam fields to produce electricity since the 1960s. The 350-degree steam rushes more than 1,500 feet up from the earth, spinning turbines that create a constant flow of electricity. ??But mismanagement of the steam fields beneath the hilly northwestern California region that straddles the Sonoma and Lake county lines has led to a large decline of pressure and a drop of more than 50 percent in the amount of power the plants produce. ??The geothermal decline comes as California already faces short supplies of hydroelectricity from the drought-ridden Pacific Northwest and growing competition for megawatts from other power-starved states. ??State power grid managers estimate they're losing about 900 megawatts of geothermal electricity due to the gradual depletion of the steam fields. That's enough power for roughly 675,000 homes. ??''They just overproduced. It is a renewable source of power, but it's renewable over geologic time,'' says Katherine Potter, a spokeswoman for Calpine Energy, which owns 19 of the 21 geothermal power plants in The Geysers region, which incidentally has no geysers. ??The first electricity produced by tapping into pockets of steam trapped in the earth made its debut in 1904 in Larderello, Italy. That plant, rebuilt due to World War II damage, is still operating. The first U.S. geothermal plant was a small operation at The Geysers built in 1962. ??Steam fields are created when water flows through fissures in the rock deep in the earth and is heated by hot magma. Geothermal plants tap into that pressure and use it to spin turbines. The plants' cooling towers release plumes of white steam, which can be seen for miles on a clear day. ??While The Geysers is a unique geologic formation called a dry steam field, there is the potential for thousands of megawatts of geothermal power from other regions that could use the more common ''wet steam'' process, said Karl Gawell, executive director of the Geothermal Energy Association in Washington D.C. ??Wet steam plants tap into superheated water in the earth, separate the steam and use it to power generators. The water and the condensed steam is pumped back into the earth. ??CalEnergy Corp. owns 10 power plants in Imperial County that produce about 330 megawatts of power, enough for about 247,500 homes. Those plants and others like them haven't seen a decline in pressure like Calpine's plants. ??Geothermal energy is second only to hydroelectricity as a continuous, cheap source of power, said Jan Stewart, Calpine's public relations manager. ??The plants in The Geysers reached their peak power production in the 1980s, producing about 2,000 megawatts of electricity enough to power about 1.5 million homes. ??At that time, about 30 companies were involved in various geothermal ventures in the area and didn't work together, Stewart said. ??''The resource wasn't being managed properly. As a result, it was a very fractured environment,'' she said. ''If one plant shut down, the steam would be vented to the atmosphere, instead of being rerouted to another plant where it could be used.'' ??In the 1960s and '70s when The Geysers got started, there was ''a real wildcatter's mentality'' among power generators, said Rich Ferguson, energy chairman for Sierra Club California. ??''Basically, they took out the water in the form of steam faster than Mother Nature was putting it back in,'' he said. ??The available steam declined, and the area now puts out about 850 megawatts, sufficient power for roughly 637,500 homes. ??Since then, geothermal engineers have learned more about managing the resource, Ferguson said. ??The superheated, self-contained system at The Geysers has no ??ater running through it. ?''The Geysers is unique worldwide. There really aren't other dry steam fields,'' Gawell said. ''In effect, there was never a sustainable level of production, you always would have depleted it eventually. It's like a giant pressure cooker. As soon as you put the first straw in, you began to deplete the resource.'' ??Calpine is experimenting with replenishing the steam fields by pumping treated waste water back into the earth. It began three years ago, when Lake County stopped pumping its treated waste water into Clear Lake. ??Now, more than 8 million gallons of treated waste water is returned daily to the earth. The experiment appears to be working _ power output is up 68 megawatts. ??''People like the stewardship that Calpine provides now,'' Ferguson said. '' Calpine has taken on as a long-term goal to make that sustainable.'' ??Calpine is building a 50-mile pipeline to Santa Rosa and plans to pump another 11 million of treated waste water daily from that city. The company expects that will boost production another 85 megawatts. ??Even with the new project, power grid managers say they're planning for diminishing geothermal electricity. ??''We've lost a considerable portion of their output due to the decline in the output of the steam,'' said Jim McIntosh, director of grid operations for the Independent System Operator. ''All supplies are very important to us at this point.'' ??The plants are relatively low-maintenance once they're running _ only one engineer staffs each of the 19 Calpine plants in The Geysers. ??But geothermal plants are more expensive to build than natural gas-fired power plants, Gaywell said. ??''It's like choosing between two identical cars one is $10,000 and the other is $30,000, but the $30,000 car comes with a lifetime supply of fuel,'' he said. ''People are shortsighted on investments and it takes more money upfront to build geothermal.'' ??Most geothermal resources are on public land, lengthening the building process because more permits are needed, Gawell said. ??Two new plants are in the application process in California. ??Researchers estimate there are 2,500 megawatts of untapped geothermal resources in Nevada, Gawell said. Idaho, New Mexico and Oregon also have sites that could be tapped, he said. ??''Many of these sites were looked at in the '80s, but then nothing happened because in the '90s natural gas was too cheap to meter,'' he said. ??Ferguson said the state spent $540 million over the last four years on incentives for renewable energy projects, including geothermal, solar, wind and biomass, and he expects the plan will be renewed when it expires in December. ??''We think there will be an equivalent amount of money,'' he said. ''All the technologies have to compete against each other, but geothermal should do pretty good.'' ??___ ??There are three types of geothermal power plants. Here's a look at how they work: ???Dry steam: Such plants are rare, producing steam and not hot water. The Geysers region is the world's largest dry steam field. Steam from the earth is piped to the power plant, where it spins turbines to create electricity. After the remaining steam condenses back to liquid, it is returned to the earth. ???Wet steam: This type of geothermal plant is more common. There are several such plants in Southern California. Hot water and steam are brought to the surface, separated and the steam is used to power turbines. The water is returned to the earth as is the condensed steam. ???Binary: These plants use hot water and steam from the earth to heat another liquid, such as isobutane, which has a lower boiling point than water. That liquid's steam is used to power turbines to make electricity. When the steam cools and becomes liquid it's returned to the tank and reused. This type of system is self-contained and has no emissions. ??___ ??On the Net: ??Geothermal Education Office: http://geothermal.marin.org ??California ISO: http://www.caiso.com ??Calpine Corp.: http://www.calpine.com ?????(PROFILE ?????(CO:Calpine Corp; TS:CPN; IG:ELC;) ?????)

BODY: ??Backers of a bill to prevent holders of concealed handgun licenses from bringing their weapons onto school property will spend the coming week trying to force a Senate vote on the issue. ??Also this week, House Speaker Mark Simmons is planning to schedule a hearing on his bill to pull the plug - at least for now - on a key part of an electric deregulation law that's due to take effect this fall for large businesses. ??The guns-in-schools bill has been on life support for weeks, with a key Senate committee chairman refusing to schedule a hearing on the bill on grounds that it is overly contentious and wouldn't pass anyway. ??The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Ryan Deckert, D-Beaverton, and other supporters aren't giving up, however. ??They are hoping to use a parliamentary maneuver that would enable them to move the school guns issue to the full Senate for debate by attaching it to another education-related bill. ??Gun owner groups say SB508 is unnecessary because there have been no documented cases of law-abiding carriers of concealed handguns causing any problems at schools. ??But a key supporter of the bill, Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, says she is convinced the measure would pass in both the House and Senate - if it can be brought up for vote. ??""I don't think we should wait to have dead children before we ban guns in schools,"" said Burdick, who was a chief sponsor of a measure passed by voters last fall expanding background checks at gun shows. ??California's power woes that were precipitated by that state's move to deregulation are giving Oregon lawmakers second thoughts about their decision to approve a phased-in deregulation of the electricity market in Oregon. ??A bill passed by the 1999 Legislature is supposed to open Oregon's electric markets to industrial and large commercial customers, beginning this October. ??The 1999 law is supposed to free large businesses to buy power on the open market, and does not deregulate electric rates for residential customers. ??Still, Simmons says that drought conditions and the power market turmoil caused by California's energy crisis require reconsideration of the law. ??For that reason, the House speaker is planning hearings this week on his proposal to enact a 15-month delay in Oregon's electricity restructuring efforts. ??""This just gives the opportunity for the energy markets to settle for a while,"" the Elgin Republican said. ??Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.

Tierney, a former assistant secretary in the Energy Department, now a consultant for Lexecon, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm. ??Like planets lining up to usher in an age of hysteria, a combination of unforeseen circumstances have put the Northwest behind the eight ball. In addition to California's self-created tangle, oil and natural gas prices are rising and a drought is stymieing the region's hydropower production. ??The situation is less volatile in other parts of the country. In the Northeast, South and Midwest, where growth has been modest and generating capacity has been more stable, there's less discrepancy between supply and demand. ??Undergirding the West's situation was some serious lack of foresight, Tierney said. ??When it looked like California power customers would be able to get electricity from whoever offered it at the cheapest price, utilities worried about recovering the money they'd spent building plants and transmission lines in the '70s and early '80s. So they sold off their power plants and bought power on the wholesale market, where it was cheap and plentiful. ??Not trusting the marketplace, California legislators capped the rates utilities could charge residential customers. When wholesale power prices went up, they couldn't pass those increases on to consumers. ??""At the time, they did not realize that in a couple of years there would not be an adequate power supply,"" Tierney said. ??California's economic explosion of the late '90s, coupled with a failure to build any new plants, brought the crisis to a head. Computers are not by themselves big energy consumers, but the factories that make them are. The Internet, with all its server farms and data hotels, also became a heavy power user. ??When demand in California finally caught up with supply, ""all of a sudden, utilities had to buy power, and it became a seller's market,"" Tierney said. ??But most of the Northwest's power comes from hydroelectric dams, and there has to be water in the rivers to power the turbines at the dams. In a drought year like this, the power has to come from somewhere else, most likely oil- and natural gas-fired plants, which fire up when demand is high. ??Because demand is so high this year, generators can charge exorbitant prices, knowing that California and the Northwest have nowhere else to buy power. ??Also, natural gas prices have gone through the roof in the last 18 months and aren't likely to come down until next year at the earliest. Until 18 months ago, the price of natural gas had been at a prolonged low, so companies weren't interested in expensive drilling projects. ??The problem is not likely to be permanent. As exploration and extraction pick up, prices will come down. The public has already begun to hear a conservation message, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is being deluged with applications for new power plant construction. ??Staff writer Paul Menser can be reached at 542-6752, or via e-mail at pmenser@idahonews.com.

FROM THE ENERGY CRISIS BYLINE: JEFF STANSBURY, Jeff Stansbury is a PhD candidate in American history at UCLA. His, dissertation is on the role of the labor movement in the building of, L.A.'s infrastructure BODY: ??Why is Los Angeles an island of tranquillity in the electric-power crisis that has rocked California and threatens to spread across the nation? ??News stories have repeatedly told us that the city's ownership and operation of its own generating stations is the principal reason. By staying clear of the state's 1996 deregulation scheme for private utilities, the Department of Water and Power was able to hold onto its power plants. ??So far, so good. But when we ask how Los Angeles came to enjoy public power in the first place, the answer commonly given makes a hash of history. ??Most historians and political scientists credit the city's progressive reform movement of 1890-1915 for having wisely settled on a municipal utility. True, some of the entrepreneurs, lawyers and reform-minded professionals who called themselves ""the best men"" during that era agitated for the city-built Owens Valley aqueduct and its generating stations. But many reformers opposed the city's effort to distribute its own power. Because they had allied themselves with railway magnate Henry Huntington, who owned an electric company, or because they favored regulation over municipal ownership, they wanted L.A.'s three private electric companies to sell and profit from aqueduct power. Meyer Lissner, a reform attorney often portrayed as a champion of public power, opposed the holding of a decisive 1911 citywide straw poll on the subject because he knew most Angelenos would cast their ballots for municipal ownership. That, he said, would be ""unfair"" to the three utilities. ??The most steadfast partisans of public power were not progressive reformers like Lissner but the city's much-maligned labor unions, and for a simple reason. While mistrust of oligopoly ran through nearly all sectors of society, it burned hottest in working-class wards. Without organized labor's dogged campaign for ""gas and water socialism,"" as well as its willingness to hand control of these resources to the anti-union regimes of Mayors George Alexander and Henry Rose, there would be no DWP today. ??Organized labor played a key role in the city's original decision to municipalize its water distribution system. On Oct. 24, 1892, 700 union members met to demand that the city build a small neighborhood waterworks as a step toward public control of the entire water supply. From that day on, L.A.'s unions never wavered in their call for a public water supply publicly managed. They mobilized the rank and file for the water-company buyouts of 1901-04, and, in 1906, the Public Ownership Party's citywide campaign primed voters to pour $ 23 million into construction of the Owens River aqueduct a year later. The aqueduct was the sine qua non of public power. At a time when most progressive reformers were mute on the subject, organized labor insisted that the aqueduct be used to generate electricity for the city's streets, homes and businesses. ??A broad consensus backed the city's construction of hydroelectric plants while the aqueduct was being built, but most of the city's politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed to public subsidies, not public ownership, of aqueduct power. The 1911 straw poll, in which city voters declared their support for municipal ownership and distribution of Owens River power, upset their plans. ??The most consistent fighters for public power during the decades after the straw poll were the Central Labor Council, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, other unions and city employees who stuffed campaign envelopes, canvassed precincts and got out the vote. Voters who favored municipally owned power and initiatives bolstering the DWP tended to be working class and Democratic; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class and Republican. ??In this polarized political climate, Mayor Alexander called for a $ 6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct-power distribution network; he left open the question of who would sell the power to consumers. Unions and socialists tied their support for the bonds to a city charter reform that would guarantee them a long-sought role in city government through proportional representation. When the reform failed at the polls, they withheld support from the power bonds, and these, too, went down to defeat in 1913. Much of the rancor workers felt was aimed at progressives like Lissner, head of the Good Government Organization, who fought labor's charter plank because it would bring socialists onto the City Council. ??The labor movement's dedication to public ownership soon reasserted itself, however. With a citywide election coming up that June, five unionists seeking council seats on the Socialist Party ticket revived labor's long-standing demand for city operation of all public utilities at cost. They urged the City Council to hold a new power-bond election with a clear public ownership mandate. They attacked the power companies' efforts to buy aqueduct power from the city and sell it to Angelenos at a profit. Soon, the great majority of unions in the Central Labor Council were locked in what turned out to be a decisive struggle against the power oligopoly made up of Southern California Edison, Pacific Light & Power and Los Angeles Gas & Electric. ??An unprecedented event brightened the bonds' chances. A machinist, Fred C. Wheeler, won a seat on the City Council, the first unionist to do so in the 20th century. Wheeler led a successful fight against an attempt to split the power-bond issue into two separate ballot propositions, one to complete the aqueduct's generating stations, the other to create a city-owned distribution system. Such a division would probably have doomed public power. ??The large majority of unionists who favored public power had little time to savor Wheeler's victory. While pressing the attack on the three electric companies, they faced a small but angry split in their own ranks. Dissenters in the Building Trades Council and a few of its unions argued that labor's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909-14 had turned the argument for municipal ownership on its head. What good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had caused the arrest of hundreds of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910, had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had denied unionists influential city jobs? The final blow was the council's rebuff of a petition signed by thousands of workers for a ""living wage"" law. Was it not folly to reward labor's foes with control of the aqueduct's power? ??Union activists who favored the bonds conceded that the dissenters were correct in their assessment of ""progressive"" city government. But the progressive star was fading. What counted in the long run was whether Los Angeles could wrest the city's electric power system from the grasp of private utilities. The Central Labor Council's unions took this challenge to heart and voted, 60-4, for a resolution favoring the bonds. ??On its own, as well as in coalition with other groups, the labor movement marshaled its rank and file on behalf of public power. It turned out hundreds of poll-watchers and canvassers on election day. The pro-bond unions never did win over the dissenting faction; rather, they overwhelmed it at the polls. On May 8, 1914, L.A.'s voters emphatically endorsed the power bonds by a hefty 71%-29%, with the city's working-class wards providing by far the largest margin of victory. ??Within a year, Los Angeles sold its bonds and began buying out the three investor-owned utilities. The first public power flowed into local homes and businesses in 1916. Two decades later, the DWP eliminated the last of its private competition and consolidated the working-class legacy of kilowatt and water socialism that has served the city so well in the current energy crisis.

BODY: ??Natural disasters and crises can be devastating but are relatively simple and easy to grasp. A brush fire you fight with shovels. An earthquake, you clean up the rubble afterward and strengthen buildings in anticipation of the next. But California's energy crisis is far different and more complex. It's a quiet disaster on scattered, invisible fronts. Most people see it only when their own lights go out. ??There also is no precedent for this crisis in California and no accurate way to forecast how bad it can get, either the blackouts or the financial consequences. But as May approaches, it's certain that most Californians are not adequately informed about the severity of the problem or what they can do to limit its impact. ??Gov. Gray Davis, the utilities and others need to engage in a crash education program that will convince Californians of the seriousness of the problem and motivate them to undertake their own conservation programs in homes and businesses. California has been a pioneer in power conservation, and its citizens will listen to persuasive reasoning. ??As the chairwoman of the state Senate's Energy Committee, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) deals with problems ranging from utility company insolvency to rate ""gaming"" by energy producers. ""But I'm really worried about this summer,"" she said last week, referring to the potential for day after day of rolling blackouts. She told of one businessman in her district who reported he will lose an estimated $ 30,000 every time his power is cut. Why not at least schedule blackouts so people can plan for them? she asked. Why not? ??In San Francisco, the Bay Area Economic Forum released a study indicating that power woes could deliver a $ 17-billion blow to the state's economy in lost production, the cost of rate increases and increased product prices. That may be conservative. The study did not include the $ 5.1 billion the state has spent so far to buy power for the insolvent private utilities. ??Republicans in the Legislature are stalling bills that would float a $ 10-billion revenue bond issue to finance power purchases and keep the state fiscally above water. They have latched onto a powerful issue, Davis' unwillingness to detail how he's spending the taxpayers' billions. Davis says he needs secrecy for competitive reasons as he bargains with power companies, though he is letting out a slightly wider trickle of figures. ??Wall Street, already wary about the credit-worthiness of the state, thinks poorly of the delay in issuing the bonds. Republicans should put a temporary hold on their battle with Davis and get the measure to the governor's desk this week. ??Lawmakers were slow in passing an $ 850-million conservation program, Bowen acknowledges. But Davis put the new program on a fast track Friday and made a smart choice in S. David Freeman, former chief of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to run the conservation effort. ??Freeman, 75, is a canny veteran of electric power politics. Davis may abhor giving out bad news, but Freeman need not shrink from it. Freeman should be on radio and television every day telling California just how bad the problem is and what they can do about it. If this were a flood, we'd be stacking sandbags. Our sandbags are conservation programs. We need to start stacking them now.

BYLINE: RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: WASHINGTON BODY: ??So what if President Bush has opposed electricity price controls sought by California officials? Or that he has proposed cutting aid to states for incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of crimes? Or that he has visited 26 states in his first 100 days in office--but not the most populous? ??Bush really does care about California, the White House insists, even if the state preferred Al Gore on election day. Administration officials said they have done a lot and plan to do more to lessen the electricity turmoil expected this summer. ??""I don't think he's treated California any differently than any other state,"" said Rep. George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa). ??Some Californians feel otherwise. ??""The Bush administration's treatment of California started at indifference, moved to neglect and has now reached actual harm,"" complained Phil Schiliro, chief of staff for Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has asked three times for a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis. Her response from the White House: a form letter with her name misspelled. ??Bush has called for requiring public agencies to buy costly earthquake insurance, a measure opposed by California lawmakers of both parties. He has proposed cutting an earthquake preparedness program. And he provided no money in his proposed budget to clean up a pile of uranium processing waste in Utah leaking into the Colorado River. ??""That's our water supply,"" political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said. ""What kind of message is that?"" ??John J. Pitney Jr., associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said Bush's apparent indifference makes political sense. ??""It's hard to argue that Bush should spend any political capital in California,"" he said. ""The 2000 election suggested that he cannot carry the state no matter how hard he tries. The Republicans have already lost several House seats and have probably hit rock bottom. . . . From a purely political angle, there's little point in giving California any money or attention that could otherwise go to more competitive states, such as Florida."" ??But Jeffe, senior scholar at USC's School of Policy, Planning and Development, said Bush's failure to visit the state is hurting GOP efforts to rebuild itself in California. ""We are ground zero for the kind of Latino outreach that he said he wanted to do."" ??And veteran California Republican political strategist Kenneth L. Khachigian said Bush at least needs to prepare for the electricity problems predicted for summer. ??""If you get three or four days of successive blackouts, air conditioners going out, traffic lights going out, a second bankruptcy--whether he wants it or not--it's his problem,"" Khachigian said. ""It would be wise for him to have a proactive stance, not just reactive."" ??Tough Act to Follow ??Some political analysts have suggested that if Bush becomes too involved in California's troubles, what is now Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' problem could become Bush's. But, Khachigian said, ""there's a fine line between taking responsibility for a problem and claiming that California isn't part of the United States."" ??In dealing with heavily Democratic California, Bush has made this much clear: He is no Bill Clinton. ??Bush has a hard act to follow. When Clinton was president, he visited California often and rewarded it with federal largess. And California in return showered him with buckets of campaign dollars and electoral votes. ??But Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) said California will benefit from Bush's presidency too. ""As Californians bear a disproportionately higher tax burden, they stand to benefit greatly from the president's tax relief plan."" ??While House spokeswoman Claire Buchan assured that Bush will visit California soon. His wife already has done so. ??As proof that California is on their mind, administration officials point to the three Californians in the Cabinet--Ann M. Veneman of Agriculture, Norman Y. Mineta of Transportation and Anthony J. Principi of Veterans Affairs--and others in top White House jobs. ??Bush also has appointed California Latinos to high-level posts: Huntington Park Councilwoman Rosario Marin as treasurer, Los Angeles entrepreneur Hector V. Barreto Jr. as head of the Small Business Administration and former San Mateo County Supervisor Ruben Barrales as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs. ??Critics said that a Californian at the top does not guarantee that the Cabinet departments will develop California-friendly policies. The proposed Agriculture budget, for example, provides only $ 5 million--not the $ 15 million that California lawmakers said they need--to fight the glassy winged sharpshooter, an agricultural pest that threatens the state's wine industry. ??A spokesman for Veneman assured that additional funding will be considered, if requested by California lawmakers. And Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), who assailed Bush for missing opportunities to help California, nonetheless expressed confidence in Veneman. ""She's going to keep pounding away to make sure that the California wine industry gets what it needs."" ??Some Good News ??Though he has proposed cuts in some programs that are important to California, Bush has taken some actions that please state officials. He has proposed a permanent research and development tax credit--an action that would particularly benefit Silicon Valley. ??His proposed budget includes additional money to crack down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling and unsafe trucks crossing into California from Mexico. And he has proposed increased funding to reduce backlogs at immigration offices. ??In one area, Bush even bested Clinton. He proposed $ 14 million to clean Lake Tahoe, more than the $ 3 million recommended by Clinton last year. ??And although he has drawn flak for proposing cuts in programs to promote energy efficiency and alternative fuels, his proposal to boost assistance to low-income families for insulating their homes and reducing their utility bills would nearly double California's allocation, to $ 8 million next year. ??No Bush policy has been more criticized in California than his approach to the state's energy woes--particularly his adamant opposition to price controls. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said Bush and his aides ""got off to a strong start"" by extending federal orders sought by the state to keep power flowing into California. ??""Since then . . . they've been AWOL,"" Maviglio said. In a reference to price controls, he added: ""They're skirting around the edges of the problem without taking the bold action they need to take."" ??""The feds are the only ones who can step in and bring some sanity to the cost of electricity in California,"" Thompson said. ??Administration officials said they have taken steps ""from our first hours in office"" to address the energy crisis. They said they have responded favorably to all the state's requests except price controls, which Bush contends would discourage the building of power plants. ??While some seek to portray Bush's opposition to price controls as unsympathetic to California's plight, a number of California's House Republicans also oppose price controls. And even those who support them argue that the issue misses the larger point. ??Rep. Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham (R-San Diego), an advocate of price controls, nevertheless said: ""I agree with the administration that the state alone remains responsible for solving this crisis."" ??Added Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs): ""I don't believe Bush should bear the brunt of responsibility that the Clinton administration left over."" ??Tim Ransdell, executive director of the California Institute for Federal Policy Research, doubted that Bush would ignore California.

Economic Growth a Welcome Surprise: The U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 2% annual rate in the first three months of the year, thanks largely to buoyant shopping by American consumers. The gross domestic product--the country's total output of goods and services--expanded at twice the pace it did in the final three months of 2000 and at twice what analysts had expected, the government said Friday. Although many analysts said the economy remains balanced between strong growth and recession, economic optimists exulted over the report. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan added to the celebratory mood by saying that a key trend behind the economy's strong performance of the last decade--its ability to improve productivity--is likely to resume despite the current slowdown. ??(Peter Gosselin) ??* ??2. Stocks Rise on Good News: The GDP report boosted stock prices, which already had gotten a lift from better-than-expected home sales figures earlier in the week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.70 to close at 10,810.05 on Friday, up 2.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 index climbed 18.53 to 1,253.05. The Nasdaq, which had fallen Thursday on concerns over weak technology profits, rose 40.80 to 2,075.68, finishing the week down 4.1%. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.33% from 5.19%. ??(Times Staff Writer) ??* ??3. Power Crisis Zaps State Bond Rating; Price Controls OKd: The mounting cost to the state general fund of buying electricity for California consumers prompted Standard & Poor's Corp. to downgrade $ 25 billion of California's general obligation bonds. S&P lowered California's bond rating by two notches, to A-plus from AA. The move could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the state's borrowing costs, bond experts said. Separately, federal regulators approved a plan to control electricity prices in California during times of supply shortages. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tied prices during power emergencies to the cost of natural gas and emission controls, among other things, with the least efficient generator setting the market price. Critics said the order contains loopholes that will allow market manipulation. ??(Nancy Rivera Brooks) ??* ??4. FTC Pans Music Industry Marketing: A much-anticipated sequel to last year's Federal Trade Commission report on the marketing of violent entertainment to children slammed the record industry for failing to heed regulators' recommendations. Though it gave some credit to the film and video-game industries for revising the way they marketed to young audiences, the FTC found the five major record conglomerates continued to advertise ""explicit-content"" albums on popular teen shows such as MTV's ""Total Request Live"" and BET's ""Top 10 Live."" Just before the release of the first report, the Recording Industry Assn. of America had blunted some of the criticism by introducing a policy against ads for such albums on TV shows or in publications whose audience is mostly 16 years old or younger. But the RIAA said it rescinded the policy in September. ??(Jeff Leeds) ??* ??5. Gas Prices Continue Upward Spiral: The average price of self-serve regular gasoline spurted higher again in California and around the nation on an increase in demand and a switch by refiners to the more costly summer gasoline blend required in parts of the country by air-quality regulations. Prices in California got an extra boost from a fire at a Los Angeles-area refinery owned by Tosco Corp. and by a change in Tosco's pricing strategy. In late March, Tosco increased wholesale prices to its dealers in Southern California and Arizona and tied prices to the cost of gasoline in the spot market. Some other major suppliers have begun matching the Tosco increase, market experts said. Some market watchers foresee gas at $ 3 a gallon or more. ??(Nancy Rivera Brooks) ??* ??6. General Dynamics Renews Newport News Bid: General Dynamics Corp. agreed to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. in a $ 2.1-billion deal that would create the nation's largest military shipbuilder and leave only one maker of U.S. aircraft carriers and submarines. The proposed merger, which the Pentagon had rejected two years ago, marks the latest in a renewed wave of consolidations in the defense industry and would again make General Dynamics one of the largest private employers in San Diego. General Dynamics executives said they are confident of receiving the necessary approvals because this time they will be dealing with the Bush administration, which may view the takeover differently. ??(Peter Pae) ??* ??7. Disney Earnings Beat Estimates: Walt Disney Co.'s second-quarter operating results exceeded Wall Street's expectations as the company's studio and consumer products units improved, although Disney did post a net loss stemming largely from a one-time charge related to the restructuring of its Internet portal. Disney also confirmed that it will shrink its venerable animation unit, with a union official estimating as many as 300 jobs of about 1,000 in Burbank could be cut. Separately, President Robert Iger confirmed that layoffs will be needed to reach Disney's previously announced goal of cutting 4,000 jobs companywide. Disney's studio and consumer products groups showed improved results in the quarter, while earnings were flat in its theme parks and softer in broadcasting. ??(James Bates) ??* ??8. New FCC Chief Vows Deregulation: Repudiating decades-old media ownership rules, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell said he envisions a broad rollback of restrictions, which could bring about a tidal wave of consolidation. In his most candid remarks about the role of the FCC since taking office, Powell said he would move in early May to eliminate regulations that prevent one company from owning a newspaper and a television station in the same city. Powell also told broadcasters meeting in Las Vegas that Viacom Inc. was likely to prevail in its challenge of federal rules that prevent any broadcaster from owning stations that reach more than 35% of the nation's television viewers. ??(Sallie Hofmeister) ??* ??9. Ford Takes More Heat Over Explorer Tires: Ford Motor Co. came under the most direct criticism leveled against it yet regarding last year's massive Firestone tire recall. Two prominent consumer safety groups issued a report saying that the auto maker was largely to blame for accidents in which Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicles, equipped with Firestone tires, spun out of control after the tires lost their treads. Though they blamed Bridgestone/Firestone for producing tires prone to failure, Public Citizen and Safetyforum.com said Ford bore the bulk of the responsibility for dictating an insufficiently robust tire design and designing the Explorer so it would overly stress the tires and tip over too easily once a tire blew. ??(Terril Yue Jones) ??* ??10. American Airlines Sued Over Health Coverage: A flight attendant filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Los Angeles, charging that American Airlines discriminated against some employees by refusing to offer insurance coverage for birth control, Pap tests and infertility treatments. The case could test the position the EEOC took in December that the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act forbids employers from excluding contraceptives from prescription drug plans. ??(Lisa Girion) ??* ??These and additional stories from last week are available at divided by category.

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried ""Wolf!"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. ??But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state -- and nobody will believe it. ???True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. ??But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators ""gaming the system"" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently -- and very profitably -- short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. ??As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that ""generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market"" -- a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. ??Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say ""apparently"" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey -- the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls -- voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. ??What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions -- ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard-to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not. ??Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls ""megawatt laundering"" -- selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to ""imports"" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: ""I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."" ??The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts -- but FERC has ignored all of them. ??The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan ""a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout"" from the looming disaster. ??Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2001 of 103 DOCUMENTS ??????????????????Copyright 2001 McClatchy Newspapers, Inc.

A1; POWER CRUNCH LENGTH: 1323 words HEADLINE: Diesel plants spark concern They're expected to generate big air-quality problems when predicted summer blackouts hit. BYLINE: Chris Bowman and Stuart Leavenworth Bee Staff Writers BODY: ??When blackouts roll across California in the coming months - as captains of the crippled electricity grid say they surely will - tens of thousands of miniature powerhouses will whine, cough and rumble to the rescue. ??These backup plants will ignite the same fuel that powers locomotives, ships and 18-wheel trucks. And they'll be spewing the same pollution - only more so, because most are old, with little or no emissions controls. ??They are diesel-powered generators, the dirtiest of internal combustion engines. And unlike trucks and other vehicles, they've largely escaped 30 years of air pollution restrictions because they were intended only for emergencies, as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power. ??But, now, as a season of multiple planned blackouts appears imminent, many California businesses are expected to fire up the old stogies more often than was ever imagined. ??And the generators will kick in when their expelled gases can do the most harm. The hot weather that taxes air conditioners and drains electricity supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas, the ingredient in smog that inflames airways and impairs breathing. ??""That is why we think this is going to be the most challenging summer ever for air quality,"" said Luna Salaver, spokeswoman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, a nine-county region with thousands of unregulated standby generators. ??""On those hot days when we want people to stop driving and doing things that pollute the air, the generators will kick in, and air quality will worsen,"" Salaver said. ??No one knows how many diesel generators are scattered around the state at hospitals, universities, factories and businesses. But air districts report there are at least 641 in Sacramento; up to 5,000 in the Bay Area; 1,200 in the San Joaquin Valley; and thousands more in the smog-plagued valleys of Southern California. ??Some are relatively clean, particularly if they have been built or retrofitted in the last few years. But most are tiny pollution factories, and were intended only to be run for short periods following natural disasters. ??According to the state Air Resources Board, a typical diesel generator emits about 50 to 100 times more smog-forming compounds per unit of energy than a typical gas-fired power plant. When the plants run for hours, people downwind can get a heavy dose of the tiny, toxic particles contained in diesel exhaust. ??""Go down to the Greyhound bus station and have them turn on their engines and hang around there - that's what it's like,"" said Michael Scheible, deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board, which regulates engines and fuels. ??Environmentalists say generators should be cranked up only during power outages. But in recent months, farmers and manufacturers have pressured regulators to redefine an emergency and allow generators to be used well before a blackout is ordered. ??Business groups say regulators need to be sensitive to data centers, chip makers and other manufacturers that can't afford even a one-second interruption in power. ??""We would like some kind of statewide policy on when and where we can use the diesel generators,"" said Gino DiCaro, a spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ""Obviously, we would like to use them more than we can now."" ??""We need to basically let go of this air-quality issue,"" said Mike Jennings, a Fresno energy consultant whose clients include members of the food-processing and dairy industries. ??State air and energy regulators are pushing energy conservation as the best way to avoid power outages. Nonetheless, the California Energy Commission has been compiling a list of generators statewide to see how their use could be coordinated, a move that stirs hope from business groups. ??""Six months ago, nobody wanted to talk about this because diesel was a big, bad word,"" DiCaro said. ""Now, at least we have agencies like the Energy Commission and the Public Utilities Commission talking about how diesel generators can fit into our electrically unreliable world."" ??Environmentalists worry that, as the summer drags on, Gov. Gray Davis will allow unrestricted use of the diesels. ??So far, the governor's staff has ""held firm,"" said Gail Ruderman Feuer, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group. ""But if blackouts start happening in a big way, they could change their tune."" ??Along with other forecasters, officials with the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's electricity grid, expect a flurry of blackouts in coming months. The next two months could be critical, because most new power plants under construction won't go on line before July. In addition, California will be losing one of its largest generators of electricity today when one of two units at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant is taken off-line for 35 days of scheduled refueling. ??""You should be ready for the worst-case scenario,"" said Del Evans, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s head of power load management, at a media briefing last week. ??For sellers and makers of diesel generators, the gloomy predictions are a gold mine. Small businesses, farmers, manufacturers - all are rushing to buy generators before the blackouts hit. ??""We are busier than we have ever been,"" said Rob Bly, president of Tuban Industrial Products Co., which assembles about 300 generators a year at its plant in Sacramento. ""We are twice as busy as we were in the height of the Y2K madness."" ??Bly says the generators he makes are ""10 times cleaner"" than ones of a decade ago. Still, he acknowledges, diesel is diesel. ??""If you are a hospital and you want standby power, you can't use propane. The fire marshall won't let you,"" said Bly. ""That leaves you with just one thing, and that is diesel."" ??Responding to such concerns, state Sen. Rico Oller, R-Andreas, introduced a bill this year to exempt thousands of backup generators from pollution controls whenever any power alert is called. The bill, however, was blocked by a Senate committee, and environmentalists say air districts have already relaxed their rules enough. ??""One of the big concerns is the cancer risk,"" Ruderman Feuer said. Air board studies, she noted, have found that a person's lifetime cancer risk increases 50 percent if he or she lives near a big diesel generator that runs 250 hours a year. ??In January, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allowed air districts to loosen their restrictions on generators. In turn, the South Coast Air Quality Management District extended the number of hours that diesel generators could be operated each year. The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District went even further, allowing businesses to run generators when state power reserves drop to 1.5 percent or when the ISO predicts blackouts anywhere in the Valley. ??The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District still requires businesses and public agencies to wait for blackouts before generators are fired up. Altogether, the district has permits for 641 generators, including major clusters at data centers and companies such as Intel. ??In the Bay Area, regulators are even more uncertain of what could happen this summer. Unlike other regions of the state, the Bay Area never required permits for diesel generators smaller than 250 horsepower. (In Sacramento, the threshold is 50 horsepower.) ??As a result, only 12 of the region's estimated 5,000 generators are subject to pollution controls. ??Salaver, the district's spokeswoman, said officials assumed the generators would be used only during earthquakes, and therefore didn't need any regulation. ??""Now, we find people are operating generators even if we are in a Stage Two alert,"" Salaver said. ""That is not what emergency generators are for."" ??* * * ??The Bee's Chris Bowman can be reached at (916) 321-1069 or cbowman@sacbee.com.

A1 LENGTH: 1544 words HEADLINE: Why Edison, PG&E split on strategy BYLINE: Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer BODY: ??One utility was more entrepreneurial, accustomed to the rough-and-tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills. ??The other was a more political animal, conversant with the language of Sacramento - and confident that negotiations and compromise with state officials could fix its problems. ??Different cultures and different circumstances sent Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on separate paths this month. Edison, run by a former president of the Public Utilities Commission, negotiated a rescue package with Gov. Gray Davis. PG&E, with fewer ties to government and possessed of an independent streak, walked away from Davis and straight into U.S. Bankruptcy Court. ??As California's energy crisis hurtles toward a summer of blackouts and higher rates, experts are debating which company found the best solution for digging its way out of billions in debt. ??""We now have two models; it'll be interesting to see who recovers the quickest,"" said Mitch Wilk, a former PUC president who is now an energy consultant in San Francisco. ??At first blush, Edison and PG&E had plenty in common. Both utilities were afflicted with the same problem: runaway wholesale electricity costs they weren't able to recover from customers because of a state-mandated rate freeze. Both had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy since January, when their losses depleted their cash reserves and credit. ??But PG&E was far sicker financially than Edison. Its debts from the state's flawed deregulation scheme reached $6.6 billion vs. $3.5 billion for Edison. That's because Edison serves a smaller territory and has more long-term supply contracts, so it was buying far less electricity than PG&E on the horrendously expensive spot market. ??Faced with a comparatively manageable loss, Edison was receptive to selling its share of California's transmission grid to the state, a deal that would generate $2.76 billion. The proceeds, along with funds from a proposed long-term bond sale, would pay off Edison's debts, according to the terms of the deal. ??Although PG&E says it was willing to sell its transmission lines, too, there was a crucial difference in the two companies' backgrounds that ultimately would influence their approach to the financial crisis. ??Unlike Edison, PG&E is a natural gas company as well as an electric company. PG&E, a subsidiary of PG&E Corp., had survived the bruising wars of natural gas deregulation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The experience took PG&E out of the cozy world of the regulated monopoly - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but was subject to state price controls - and into the world of competition. ??The experience gave PG&E more of a free-market bent, said a former PUC staffer who requested anonymity. ??So even though Davis' aides say the governor offered PG&E a plan that would have paid off its debts - including $3 billion to $4 billion for its share of the grid - the utility balked at a key provision. While the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002, Davis was insisting the utility remain regulated for a decade. ??PG&E wanted an immediate end to Public Utilities Commission regulation, and would agree only to a cursory review of rates through ""a jury-rigged arbitration,"" Davis said last week. ??""I believe PG&E was in denial,"" Davis said in an interview with Bee editors and reporters. ??PG&E says it wasn't demanding an end to regulation. Rather, what it wanted - and what Davis' negotiator Michael Peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity, said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ??In that same deal, reached Feb. 25 in Los Angeles, PG&E made a ""handshake agreement"" to sell its transmission grid, Low said. He wouldn't reveal the price. ??In the weeks that followed, the governor's team reneged, Low said. ""The discussions and negotiations broke down because they would not agree to the basic principles that were reached by (PG&E Chairman) Bob Glynn and Michael Peevey,"" Low said. ??PG&E also became disgusted with a series of PUC rulings in late March and early April that it believed would seriously hinder its ability to recover its debts. ??Things came to a head April 5 when Davis proposed a rate increase and outlined his rescue plan in a televised address. A few minutes later, Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street financier advising Davis, and other Davis advisers held a conference call in which they fleshed out the details for investors. Edison officials and directors listened in, but PG&E didn't, Fichera said. ??""They had made up their minds,"" Fichera said, referring to PG&E officials. ??The next morning, with Glynn dismissing Davis' speech as ""a lot of words,"" the utility filed for bankruptcy protection. ??That afternoon, Davis called PG&E ""selfish"" and pointedly went into a negotiating session with John Bryson, the chairman and chief executive of Edison's parent Edison International. ??For Davis, the meeting was crucial. Although Edison had tentatively agreed in February to sell its transmission lines, the deal wasn't sewn up and Davis was nervous the PG&E bankruptcy would prompt Edison's creditors to ""jerk Edison into bankruptcy,"" Davis said last week. ??That afternoon, ""conceptually we reached an agreement,"" Davis said. The deal was announced the following Monday. ??Consumer advocates and some legislative leaders blasted the agreement as a giveaway, and said Davis hastily sweetened the terms for Edison because he needed to show progress on the energy crisis in the wake of the PG&E imbroglio. ??Not true, Davis said; the basic terms were already on the table before PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Either way, Edison was receptive to negotiating with Davis. ??Edison's background is different from PG&E's. Because it isn't in the natural gas business, it doesn't have the track record PG&E does with free markets. It is more comfortable in the regulatory and political realm, experts say. ??Notably, Bryson was president of the PUC in the 1970s - when Davis was Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of staff. ??""He knows Gray Davis,"" said ex-PUC President Wilk. ""He may feel a higher level of comfort in dealing with a very adversarial process. He felt he could rely on the governor."" ??Politically savvy, Edison is one of the utility industry's biggest contributors to national political campaigns, and it usually spends more than PG&E on California campaigns. Edison International's board of directors includes Los Angeles attorney Warren Christopher, the former U.S. secretary of state and an elder statesman of the Democratic Party. ??Though it's open to negotiations, Edison isn't a pussycat. To the contrary, experts say. ??""It was usually Edison that was more combative than PG&E,"" said Tom Willoughby, a retired PG&E lobbyist. ??Wilk agreed, adding: ""I find it curious that PG&E's being painted as the confrontational, aggressive company and Edison as the get-along, company."" ??Edison hasn't been shy about going to Sacramento for favors; last year, for example, Edison wanted some changes made in the operation of the state's power grid. Instead of talking to the grid manager, the Independent System Operator, Edison went to the Legislature, a source said. Lawmakers then pressured the ISO to make the changes. ??One more factor may have played into Edison's willingness to deal with the governor. ??Last year it became involved in a protracted dispute with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the transmission grid, over how much profit Edison could earn from the grid. ??Edison eventually won its point, but the case influenced the utility's thinking when Davis offered to buy the grid. According to industry consultant Barbara Barkovich, Edison figured, why wrestle with the federal government over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale? ??Besides, Edison has a back-up plan if the Legislature scraps the grid purchase, as many lawmakers have threatened. The company has said it would follow PG&E's lead and file for bankruptcy. ??But its willingness to negotiate with the governor will have served it well, even if it goes into bankruptcy, said Nancy Day, a utility industry veteran consulting for the Legislature. ??Day said she believes the governor's appointees on the PUC will ""punish"" PG&E for its behavior. If Edison winds up in bankruptcy court, it ""won't be punished for it,"" Day said. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch couldn't be reached for comment. ??Energy companies at a glance Edison Main subsidiary: Southern California Edison Headquarters: Rosemead, Los Angeles County Customers: 4.2 million in Southern California Chairman: John Bryson Performance: Lost $1.94 billion in 2000 on revenue of $11.72 billion Stock ticker symbol: EIX ??PG&E Main subsidiary: Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

BYLINE: Dan Walters BODY: ??No one knows for certain how - or when - California's energy crisis will conclude. It is an inordinately complicated four-dimensional chess game that has so far defied politicians' simplistic - perhaps simple-minded - efforts at resolution. ??That said, one may speculate reasonably on the financial, social and political consequences for California in the months and years ahead. ??Financially, Californians - especially the 70 percent who are served by private electric utilities - will feel the pinch for years, if not decades, to come. Before the crisis hit, California's power rates were already among the highest in the nation. Given the nearly $20 billion in power purchase debts that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far, the stubbornly high wholesale prices and other data, it's not unreasonable to project that Californians in private utility areas will see their rates double, or rise even higher. ??Politicians have been laying the rhetorical groundwork for big increases, although they've been disingenuous about the outer parameters. The burden will fall most heavily on business customers and, coupled with doubts about power reliability and rising natural gas prices, will damage the state's ability to attract job-creating investment. States with low and stable energy prices already are using the crisis as a recruiting tool. In February, Intel President Craig Barrett told the Wall Street Journal: ""As long as California is a Third World country, we won't build $2 billion manufacturing plants here."" ??The inevitable escalation of utility rates will create distortions within the state as well, since utility rates for the 30 percent of Californians served by publicly owned utilities are not likely to rise by more than token amounts. The municipal utilities' rates were roughly a third lower than private utilities' rates prior to the crisis. By the time the dust settles, they may be just half as much. It will contribute to the balkanization of California that was already being defined by such factors as housing prices, ethnicity and income levels. Low-cost regions will become magnets for people and jobs while high-price regions will be shunned. ??The energy crisis will certainly be the defining issue of the 2002 elections, and perhaps for others to follow. Gov. Gray Davis' popularity has plummeted since he took charge of the crisis, laying waste to his intentions to seek an easy re-election next year as a middle-of-the-road, business-friendly, tough-on-crime education reformer. ??With his popularity waning, Davis may be compelled to turn left, shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers and other liberal elements of the Democratic Party. That, in turn, would undermine the triangulating strategy he has pursued, in which he took Democratic voters for granted and cultivated business executives and social conservatives. Business interests are worried, for example, that Davis may now feel compelled to sign union-friendly legislation, such as boosts in workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, that he vetoed in the past. ??Davis' relations with fellow Democrats in the Legislature have turned from cool to poisonous, with lawmakers openly trashing his leadership and management of the energy crisis and worrying that he'll try to shift the blame to them if the crisis turns to disaster. If Democratic leaders fear that voters will be in a throw-the-bums-out mood next year, they may throttle back on intentions to maximize their party strength in drawing new legislative districts. Such maximization would require spreading Democratic voters out among many districts, and such margin-thinning could make Democrats vulnerable in an energy crisis-spawned voter rebellion. Democrats may well strive for fewer but safer seats. ??These are but a few of the potential effects that California will experience long after the immediate crisis has faded, whenever that may be. ??* * * ??The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com.

D1 LENGTH: 1419 words HEADLINE: The energy crisis is good for you SOURCE: Insight Senior Writer BYLINE: Louis Freedberg BODY: Here's a message for pampered and overindulged citizens of the Golden State who complain unceasingly about high energy bills and the day-to-day prospect of rolling blackouts: Stop whining. ???It's not a crisis -- it's an opportunity. The energy ""crisis"" is good for us. ???For decades, we burned lights whenever we wanted, bought more and more energy-guzzling appliances, bigger and bigger television sets. Today, as citizens of the richest state in the world's only superpower, who is going to tell us when to stop? ???""We talk about having to hit mules over the head with a 2 by 4 to get their attention, but I don't think human beings are much more responsive or foresighted. I hate to see people suffering, but on the other hand, if that is the way we learn, so be it,"" says Ernest Callenbach, the Berkeley author of the futuristic 1975 novel, ""Ecotopia."" Callenbach's work was a major influence on the alternative energy policies of former Gov. Jerry Brown. ???Nowhere has the ethic of unlimited consumption been more out of control than in the Bay Area, where the energy demands of high tech outstripped what the electricity grid could supply. Aside from the energy needs of the industry itself, the wealth it generated encouraged avaricious lifestyles that include power-swilling mansions and freeways clogged with monster sport utility vehicles. ???Perhaps the 34 days of blackouts some experts predict for this summer will bring the discipline that eludes us. Except for the hardships the crisis has inflicted on the poor, Californians still enjoy a sybaritic lifestyle that, in ways, would put to shame the pharaohs of Egypt or the court of Louis XIV. Lights still burn when they're not needed. Except for very occasional blackouts, electricity still flows 24 hours a day. Our daily routines have barely been affected. A visitor from another state or country would have a hard time finding signs of our highly publicized ""crisis."" ???As we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the state Public Utilities Commission, imagine what life was like for Native Americans who lived for millennia in a bounteous Bay Area without microwaves, waffle irons, air conditioning or 24-cubic-foot refrigerators. No one is suggesting that we revert to those days. But let's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the piles of appliances whose tangle of cords clogs our homes and offices. ???Smug Californians love to point to the state's ranking as a miserly consumer of energy -- only three other states consume less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become greedy energy hogs. Tougher efficiency standards have helped, but so has our great weather. ""California has a uniquely good climate to be efficient,"" says Dan Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. ""Compared to countries with much harsher climates, we have not done enough."" ???There's no denying the sudden, sharp pain caused by the crisis -- from threats of sky-high electric bills to fears that California's economic engine is near collapse. But if we handle it right, all kinds of positive energy will result. Potential benefits extend from the spiritual (a revival of the conservation ethic) to the curative (making the state immune to power-problem overloads) to the liberating (throwing off for good our dependence on the Texas energy overlords). ???Consumers, shocked into action by tripled or quadrupled energy bills, are already rushing to Bay Area hardware stores, snapping up setback thermostats, hot water heater blankets, insulating window film and outdoor clotheslines. Alan Ginsberg of Satco Products in Hayward, who imports from China container-loads of squiggly shaped energy-saving fluorescent bulbs, says, ""They're flying out the door."" ???More significantly, the crisis impels the state to move ahead with the construction of badly needed power plants. It puts on the agenda of public debate the fundamental question of whether our energy system should be in the hands of giant utilities or run by municipalities or by the state. It certainly unveiled the greed of out-of-state energy producers who have sucked billions of dollars from California. ???The crisis has also made us focus on fundamental flaws in our energy grid, such as the 4,500-megawatt electricity shortage that emerged in the 1990s while we were all reveling in California's boom times. ???By exposing those who got us into this predicament -- producers, utilities, regulators and politicians -- there's a chance we'll get out of it with a more rational and efficient energy grid and be better prepared to deal with challenges down the road. If that happens, Gov. Gray Davis might yet confound critics who say his political prospects are sinking faster than you can say ""megawatt."" ???The ease and convenience of modern life fools us into thinking that power, water and food are infinite. Flip a switch and the lights magically go on. Turn a faucet and water flows. These days, the biggest challenge in gathering our daily bread is the hunt for a space in the supermarket parking lot. ???And we want it all, leading us straight into denial. We want instant, abundant power -- but we don't want any new power plants, especially in our backyards. Coal is dirty. Natural gas is expensive. Dams kill salmon. Nuclear power? Forget about it. The contradictions haven't mattered -- so long as an endless supply of electrons flowed from our wall outlets. But that mindless ease, the crisis taught us, is history. ???The energy crisis warns us that we must become more self-sufficient or risk slipping toward oblivion if we continue to spend billions of dollars on shrinking non-renewable energy sources such as coal and natural gas. ???The Roman Empire fell because of the decadence of its ruling elites. And the British empire, dependent on raw materials from the colonies, began to collapse when it became too expensive to import goods across oceans. ???A new consciousness about where electricity comes from is the first step toward using less of it. It could also translate into a greater awareness of other environmental causes. ???If we get the message, ""the net outcome (of the energy crisis) will be a quite profound shift in consciousness in energy conservation,"" predicts Michael Lerner, executive director of Commonweal, a health and environmental institute in Bolinas. ???Such a turnaround is no snap. ???During the last energy crisis in the 1970s, there was a similar rush toward conservation. President Jimmy Carter installed solar panels on the White House roof. President Ronald Reagan took them down. He also phased out tax credits and other inducements to encourage development of renewable energy sources. ???Closer to home, one of former Gov. George Deukmejian's first acts was to abolish the Office of Appropriate Technology established by Gov. Jerry Brown to move us away from our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. ???Since then, we have regressed further. Even record high gasoline prices have done nothing to depress the sales of SUVs, which now account for the largest share of automobile and light truck sales (20 percent at last count). ???But today's crisis could lead to permanent changes in behavior, if only because the technology needed to harness sun, wind and other renewable energy sources has become far more cost effective than a generation ago. California already gets 12 percent of its energy from these ""alternative"" sources, and the market incentives to develop them further has never been higher. ???Stratospherically high electricity bills could finally force on us the technological changes and the discipline that Europeans -- who use two-thirds as much energy per capita as we do -- and the Japanese -- who use only half as much -- have had to embrace. ???This difficult moment in California's history has already yielded some ecological epiphanies, like those experienced by Ernest Callenbach's neighbors. They installed solar photovoltaic cells on their roof. The installation now puts surplus electricity back into the energy grid, instead of sucking more out of it. ???""The magical moment is the idea that by having a photovoltaic cell on your roof, you can make your electric meter run backward,"" said Callenbach. ""Instead of it going to the right, you actually see it going in the other direction. You say to yourself, 'Oh Lord, Oh Lord, I have seen the future.'

Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that he's on top of the state's energy crisis and, as he said at one gathering last week, ""in three years this problem will be a distant memory."" Fat chance. All major aspects of the situation are growing worse, not better, minute-by-minute. ??Politicians took over the crisis in January as the state's major utilities exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit. Davis began what he said then would be a short-term, emergency program of power purchases to keep electrons flowing into homes and businesses. ??From that moment forward, the situation has steadily deteriorated, moving toward a three-pronged disaster: severe summer blackouts, the bankruptcy of the utilities and sharply escalating power bills. With the bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and decisions by Davis and the Public Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates, two of the three negative scenarios are now in place. And everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindle. ??The Davis strategy, if there is one, is to continue the state's massive power purchases while negotiating longer-term and presumably cheaper supply contracts, encourage conservation, help utilities pay off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers, and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch. ??Currently, the governor is touting his deal with Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison, to sell its portion of the grid and is working on a similar deal with Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas and Electric. But PG&E's bankruptcy casts doubt on the viability of the cash-for-grid concept and legislators, particularly Davis' fellow Democrats, are very skeptical of the Edison deal. ??Clearly, Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PG&E filed bankruptcy, in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latter action, but its provisions are being labeled a ""bailout"" by critics. It places only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing the profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts. ??Meanwhile, the state is spending -- by Davis' own account -- about $70 million a day or $2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases, paying roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level. And the current futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jump by another 50 percent by mid-summer; higher prices and greater purchases could increase the drain on the state treasury to as much as $5 billion a month. ??State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a ""bridge loan"" to relieve pressure on the state's rapidly vanishing reserves, but Wall Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of what's happening and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature. ??He said Tuesday that Davis, who has maintained secrecy on power purchases, must offer a comprehensive and public plan for dealing with the financial squeeze. ??Meanwhile, bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities. ??Davis, for some reason, is unwilling to declare this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts shut down air conditioners, respirators and traffic lights. He insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances that things will turn out all right, even declaring to reporters this past Tuesday that ""we think we'll have this thing licked by the end of fall."" ??It's time for someone -- the governor, preferably, but someone -- to lay out for Californians exactly what's happening, the downside financial and power supply risks, and what's being done to deal with the looming disaster facing this state. ??It's time for politicians to treat us as adults who can face reality, not as children to be fed sugarcoated sound bites and slogans. ??-- Dan Walters writes for the Sacramento Bee.

BYLINE: NANCY VOGEL and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Two top state energy officials said Friday that a federal plan to stabilize electricity prices in California could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is illegal. ??In a barrage of complaints attacking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the state's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing California's transmission grid said they might challenge the federal order in court. ??The order was approved on a 2-1 vote Wednesday and released to the public late Thursday. ??""We're going to take whatever actions we can to oppose this to the extent our lawyers tell us it's illegal,"" said Michael Kahn, an attorney named by Gov. Gray Davis to head the board overseeing the California Independent System Operator. Cal-ISO manages the transmission grid reaching three-quarters of the state. ??In a conference call with reporters, Kahn and Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said the order also seems to indicate that FERC is unwilling to force power sellers to rebate any of the extraordinary profits earned before last October in California's market, where wholesale electricity prices began soaring last May. ??And, according to Kahn, the federal order illegally ties limits on power prices to a requirement that California link its transmission grid with those of other states. ??""It's not within their authority to have this kind of linkage,"" he said. ??The federal order is scheduled to take effect May 29. Though it is not clear how the order will play out in the state's electricity market, Lynch and Kahn said they do not believe it will bring down power costs or help the state avoid blackouts, as intended. ??""They're creating a whole new, wholesale blackout system,"" said Lynch, referring to a section of the order that allows large customers, such as steel mills and food processors, to get paid to shut down when grid operators are struggling to find enough electricity to meet demand. ??Though a somewhat similar program has helped California avoid blackouts, the federal order requires state power buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they shut down customers. ??The requirement of naming a price could lead to more blackouts, said Stanford University economist Frank Wolak, because it prevents power buyers from paying more if that's what it takes to keep electricity flowing. ??""Stating your price and sticking to it means that somebody could call your bluff,"" Wolak said. ""The generators just say, look, we can't supply all you want at the price you want to pay. ??""So they supply everything they can at the price we're willing to pay--and no more--and we have rotating blackouts,"" he said. ??Lynch said that no matter how this aspect of the FERC order unfolds, ""it ain't for Washington bureaucrats to decide when the lights go out in California. "" ??Grid operators at Cal-ISO must quickly buy batches of electricity to constantly match supply and demand on the transmission system serving most of the state, excluding the city of Los Angeles. When Cal-ISO cannot find enough power, it must order Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric to trigger rotating blackouts. ??The state suffered such controlled outages on four days in January and March, and many such days are predicted for this summer as air conditioning drives up demand for power. ??In other energy news Friday, Gov. Gray Davis announced in Los Angeles that electricity use in California state office buildings dropped by an average of 20% in the first two months of this year, compared to the same months of 2000. State workers have been under orders since late last year to turn off nonessential lights, computers, printers and other electrical appliances. Some agencies have even changed workers' schedules, eliminating ""flextime"" so that everyone works the same hours and the offices can open later and close earlier, shortening the energy-using day. ??* ??Times staff writer Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

BACKERS SAY PLAN WOULD BOOST SUPPLY, BUT FOES SEE IT COSTING CALIFORNIA DEARLY. BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??A Texas congressman plans to introduce legislation next week that would allow California's small power producers to sell their supplies on the wholesale market--a move that could threaten Gov. Gray Davis' plan to end the state's energy crisis. ??The proposal by Republican Rep. Joe Barton, the influential chairman of the House energy and air quality subcommittee, would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state's two biggest investor-owned utilities and sell their supplies to a third party. ??Proponents say the bill could dramatically bolster the state's electricity supplies by luring producers whose plants have been shut down by payment disputes to restart them in time for summer, when supplies are expected to be tight and blackouts are feared. ??But allowing producers to sell to a third party would essentially devastate Davis' plan to rescue the utilities and get the state out of the business of making emergency electricity purchases. ??The governor's plan is based on California locking down the costs of electricity from the utilities and small power producers for several years, at a reduced cost. ??During that time, the state would buy the remaining portion of the electricity the utilities need to serve their customers. Meanwhile, the utilities would regain their financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for being allowed to recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on electricity bills. ??If the alternative producers were allowed to sell their power on the wholesale market, the state could be forced to purchase much more electricity on the expensive open market. ??That would dramatically increase California's already massive power costs, forcing the state to further raise electricity rates and borrow even more than the record $ 12 billion in bonds it is planning to finance the plan. The state has spent more than $ 5 billion buying electricity that the utilities cannot afford, and Davis expects to spend $ 15 billion by year's end. ??""It is a way of busting the budget for the state of California,"" said Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street energy consultant hired by the Davis administration. He called the potential release of the small producers a ""disaster scenario"" for the state. ??Added Stephen E. Frank, chairman, president and chief executive of Southern California Edison: ""Releasing them from their contractual obligations will simply exacerbate the problem, because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state's problems."" ??But Eugene Peters of the Electric Power Supply Assn. disputed that contention. The state, he said, is already buying replacement supplies on the open market because of reduced output by small producers. ??""If 3,000 megawatts are made available again, it will have a potentially profound effect on what people pay for power by bolstering overall electricity supplies,"" Peters said. ??Utility executives contend that only 1,200 megawatts are offline because of payment problems. ??California is home to nearly 700 small energy producers, which generate more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in the state. They differ from their big out-of-state counterparts, which have been getting paid by the state. ??The Barton proposal will be the subject of public hearings Tuesday and Thursday, and could move to the full House Energy and Commerce Committee for a vote the next week. Barton could not be reached for comment Friday. ??The alternative-energy provision is one of several in his emergency energy bill. Others designed to help the West through a difficult summer of price spikes and energy shortages range from offering federal aid to relieving a bottleneck in the transmission system to permitting governors to secure waivers from environmental rules to boost power supplies. ??The provisions dealing with waivers of environmental rules have been among the most controversial, drawing opposition from environmentalists. ??* ??Times staff writer Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story.

The PUC told Edison and SDG&E to begin listing on electricity bills by June 1 the ""outage block"" into which each customer falls. ?The utilities then must use their Web sites to tell customers which blocks are slated for blackouts should more rotating outages be required. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. already lists outage block numbers on its customer bills. A pop-up box on PG&E's Web site shows which blocks are next in line for blackouts. Edison and SDG&E said they have been working on implementing such notification on their own and will comply with the PUC ruling.

BYLINE: Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer BODY: ??From the shipwreck of California's electric industry, Albert Vera sees a chance to build a life raft. ??""This is an opportunity that shall never come again,"" the former Culver City mayor told city and county officials gathered this week in Sacramento. ??Every rate hike, every blackout, every corporate bonus is more evidence for believers that it's time for local government to get into the power business. They pin their hopes on municipal utility drives in San Francisco, Corona, San Diego County and beyond. ??Over the past few years, however, only a handful of cities have set up their own electric departments, and they are mostly limited entities that fall short of full-fledged utilities. More commonly, cities - including Davis, Lincoln and Culver City - have studied the idea and rejected it, at least temporarily. ??They all face the same question, said Santa Rosa City Manager Jeffrey Kolin: ??""Is the investment worth the risk? Most of us would say we don't know yet."" ??Kolin's city, like scores of others across the state, has decided it is time to study the issue anew, motivated by the prospect of soaring electric bills, repeated blackouts, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing. ??""All their citizens are screaming,"" said Yvonne Hunter, a lobbyist for the League of California Cities. ??The highest visibility fight will likely come in November, when San Franciscans go to the polls to decided whether to create their own utility in a city that houses PG&E's corporate headquarters. ??""We will take it very seriously,"" PG&E spokesman John Nelson said. ??Shortly after deregulation in 1996, several drives for ratepayer-owned utilities stumbled or stalled. An effort in the far north state to create a multicounty public power agency was rejected by state regulators because some local governments objected. ??Now, with a bill to create a state power authority moving through the Legislature, some believe the climate may be changing. ??""One of the things this crisis has proved is the value of local control,"" said Jerry Jordan, head of the California Municipal Utilities Association. ??Since January, the cities of Hercules in the Bay Area and Corona in Southern California have formed utilities to deliver electric service to new neighborhoods - a strategy that sidesteps potential condemnation fights with the existing utility. The county of San Diego is trying to get special legislative authority to create a regional power agency without a popular vote. ??""We could produce power better, cheaper and faster than the private sector,"" county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said. ??Not so, say PG&E and Southern California Edison. ??""There's been much more talk of it, but as soon as most folks sit down and take a look at the realities ... they realize that they would have to buy on the same market, at the same outrageous prices that we and the state have been paying,"" Nelson said. ""The talk quickly evaporates."" ??For-profit utilities have long argued that government shouldn't usurp the role of private industry in delivering electricity. PG&E contends that the factors that once made public power attractive - such as access to low-cost electricity from federal dams - have evaporated. ??In addition, cities that try to withdraw from PG&E or Edison now probably would still have to funnel money their way for years to come, to pay off still-unsold state bonds that will stretch out a single year's power costs for up to 15 years. ??With so many unknowns, the next few years are likelier to produce more studies than new utilities, said a number of city officials who attended a seminar in Sacramento this week, sponsored in part by the American Public Power Association. ??Former New York state Sen. Al Coppola told the group the session should have been titled: ""Independence from the greedy robber baron utilities."" ??Public power backers share three key beliefs: ??* They can charge customers less because they don't have to pay dividends to investors or pay taxes on their sales; they can respond to local preferences on issues like which customers pay the lowest rates and how blackouts are staged; and existing utilities will do everything in their power to oppose them. ??""Edison did the right thing - (use) fear,"" to discourage Culver City from creating an electric arm in 1995, Vera, the city's former mayor, told the group. ??And Glenn Prentice, head of the newly created Corona electric utility, said in an interview that a half-dozen other cities have contacted him for more information, but he declined to name them. ??""If I do, Edison will start the attack on them. We're talking about a lot of money,"" he said. ""We're here to serve the public. They're here to make money."" ??PG&E sees new utilities as ""competition for our business,"" and it has a policy of lobbying hard against them, Nelson said. ??Less than 18 months ago, it warned residents of the Placer County town of Lincoln that a city power enterprise would be costlier and less dependable than PG&E, and its officials labeled the effort a ""tax dodge."" ??But by January of this year, PG&E barely blinked when Hercules set up a utility to deliver power and telecommunications service in new neighborhoods. ??""We got more resistance from AT&T and PacBell,"" said Raj Pankhania, assistant to the city manager of Hercules. ??Pankhania has been researching utility drives across the state and has seen no groundswell for public power, although he believes it can bring cities added revenue and more local control. ??That could change this summer, Prentice said. ??""It really depends on how bad the blackouts are."" ??A blackout that left one city councilmember's daughter at a darkened school was part of what led the Riverside County city of Corona to vote April 4 to form its own electric arm, he said. Heavy industry became anxious, too. ??""They said to the city council, 'Do something!' "" Prentice said. ??Skipping detailed studies, Corona quickly decided to create a utility that will build small power plants, under 50 megawatts, to serve city operations and new neighborhoods in the city of 127,000 east of Disneyland. ??In time, said Hercules' Pankhania, cities like his could become the living laboratory for whichever system can deliver better service and lower rates. ??Hercules' plans calls for the older two-thirds of its homes and businesses to retain their PG&E service and the newest third to be served by the city utility. ??""The existing homeowner will definitely compare five to 10 years down the road,"" he said. ""Then let the people decide which way they want to go."" ??* * * ??The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2001",important

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers, prices eventually fall. So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer? The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal, given the possible consequences. Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers, threatening to further depress California's already slumping economy - the sixth largest in the world. But desperate times require drastic measures, according to the economists, lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway. ""It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than simply to suffer them,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group. Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on ""would be like playing with fire,"" counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. ""Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. They cost businesses a lot of money."" Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion, in money otherwise spent on education, public safety and health care, Shames said. Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit, some lawmakers think it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many of whom are based outside the state. This Tuesday, the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost. ""We have been over a barrel in so many ways,"" said Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado, who sponsored SB73x. ""Maybe there's a point in the market where (we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead."" Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. ""It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option,"" said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein, one of the energy experts who have studied the idea. The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike, economists say. Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies, leading to even higher prices at the pump, and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare. And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm, for example, need power at any price. Without electricity, Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. ""It would be a real hardship for us,"" said Jarzemkoski, 78. ""I'm on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we need power."" Despite such concerns, the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the state's staggering electricity bill. The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies, California might spend more than $1 billion each week, state officials estimate. Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost, economists say. When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 18-19, the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion, mostly from lost profits and wages, estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state, and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices, even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating, economists argue. As it is, California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer, making some blackouts a virtual certainty. The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 billion, according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum. The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed, much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. ""Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get re-elected,"" said Borenstein, director of the University of California's energy institute. ""As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off, the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick."" Still, Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course, said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak, who heads the Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee. ""This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign,"" he said. ""The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices."" The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices. After making record profits last year, power wholesalers Enron, Reliant, Dynegy, Duke Energy, Williams and Mirant and earned a combined $1.6 billion during the first three months of this year. --- On The Net: Bay Area Economic Forum report: Electric Power Research Institute: http://www.epri.com Utility Consumers' Action Network Report: INDIA: Indian banks appeal to govt to help end Enron row 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY, May 3 (Reuters) - Indian lenders to U.S. energy group Enron Corp's gas-fired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the company's row with a state-owned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills. The board of Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved. In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol, which operates the world's largest gas-fired plant on the west coast of India, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Bombay. Indian financial institutions, which contributed $1.4 billion towards the project in loans, are pressing the government to help end the crisis, a source told Reuters. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, last month took the major step of bailing out of the $2.9 billion power project, citing non-payment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The DPC board's move sparked widespread fears that India's image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged. POWER STRUGGLE MSEB, which is a state-owned utility, has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly. It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the project's second phase which is to begin operations later this year. Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power 1.34 billion rupees ($28.60 million) for electricity it bought in March. But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of 2.26 billion rupees ($48.2 million), which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state, and the federal government. The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January. The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so. ""We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast,"" the source added. The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project, cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added. ($1=46.82 Indian rupees). DNC: Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy 05/03/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) WASHINGTON, May 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Democratic National Committee issued the following today: Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like, and it is long on oil and short on conservation. But something was missing from the coverage of Cheney's announcement: not just who benefits from the Bush plan, but who's writing it as well. (Photo: ) It's hard to understate the influence big donors and high-ranking executives have with the Bush Administration. Take Tom Kuhn, for example, one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels. Kuhn, a top Bush fundraiser, also served on Bush's Energy Department transition advisory team, and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House. Not surprisingly then, the Big Oil Bush Administration's energy policy could not make Bush's huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier. Since the energy industry's problems are Bush's problems, the first things on Bush's hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check -- and our country clean. With an energy executive running around the West Wing, Bush's energy policy could be summed up as, ""Drill anywhere, anytime, and keep those checks coming."" The Democratic Party is committed to fighting for a balanced energy policy that keeps our country's priorities -- such as a clean environment -- in mind. To learn more about Bush's misplaced priorities and kowtows to the special interests, keep reading to find out the ""Top Ten Paybacks To The Energy Industry,"" and to see how you, too, can get on the Bush gravy train in ""Recipe for a Quid Pro Quo,"" courtesy of the Democratic Party's http://www.100DaysofBush.com. BUSH'S TOP TEN PAYBACKS TO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY One of the most obvious and recurring themes of Bush's first 100 days has been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new administration. Oil and gas interests are some of Bush's top campaign contributors, giving more than $3 million to get Bush elected. In exchange, Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such things as air conditioner efficiency, as well as breaking his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments. Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing, while cutting funding for energy conservation programs. He has also repaid top donors, lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration. Here is just a sampling of how the oil, gas and other energy industries have benefited in Bush's first 100 days: 2 - BUSH TAKES HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA CRISIS WHILE ENERGY COMPANIES MAKE MILLIONS Bush Did Little to Aid California in Energy Crisis; Fleischer Said Crisis is a ""California Matter."" Bush has done little to aid California in its energy crisis, such as refusing to support wholesale price caps on electricity. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter, dealing with the legislation that is before the state. And the leaders of California are working to address that in their own right."" Fleischer also said that Bush wanted to focus on a ""long term"" national energy policy. (AAP Newsfeed, 1/23/01; Wall Street Journal, 1/23/01) Texas Energy Company Accused of Price Gouging to Make Money off California's Energy Crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered further inquiry into allegations by California officials that El Paso Natural Gas Co., a Houston based subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., manipulated the natural gas market by keeping supply artificially low, contributing to the high price of electricity in the state. El Paso Energy was one of the Texas firms ""grandfathered"" by Bush's voluntary emissions standards in Texas. Between 1993 and 1998, El Paso Energy and El Paso Natural Gas PACs gave a total of $8,000 to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns. During the 1999-2000 election cycle, El Paso Energy Corp. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. gave a total of $743,029 to Bush and the GOP -- $460,395 to GOP in soft money, $247,750 to GOP candidates from its PAC, and $34,884 to the Bush campaign from its employees and executives.

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the French-Italian border and was set to enter the German power market. ""We have done some wholesale trading on the Italy-France border, moving power from France to Italy, and we are very close to doing some in Germany,"" said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters. ""This year we will significantly increase our trading in (mainland) Europe; we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment,"" he added. Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon, southern England, from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets. FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent. But the early signs were that France would also play a key role, particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UK-France undersea interconnector cable. ""France has taken me by surprise. It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation,"" said West. A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France, including TXU Europe, Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, according to traders. West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France, not always from French companies, and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries. Innogy had bought some of the 400-megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions, he said. ""It's easy to trade through France, the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule, although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult,"" said West. He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE. Andy Duff, managing director of generation and trading, added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level, as well as a trading level, depending on how effectively the UK-France interconnector could be used. ""The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges,"" said Duff. Innogy may look to trade on Germany's two power exchanges as well as that country's burgeoning over-the-counter market. The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). FOCUS ON TRADING, NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogy's strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets. ""We are not going to lead with assets in Europe. We will focus on trading services-type arrangements, extracting value from (other companies') assets. That's the main thrust of the business,"" he said. West said Innogy's trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged. The company already trades around the UK-Belgium gas interconnector. Mosaic Group posts strong first quarter results 05/03/2001 Canada NewsWire (Copyright Canada NewsWire 2001) -- Diluted Cash Earnings per Share Increases by 29% and Revenues up by 89% -- TORONTO, May 3 /CNW/ - Mosaic Group Inc. (MGX:TSE), Canada's leading outsourced marketing services agency, announced today that it continued its trend of strong earnings growth for the period ending March 31, 2001. Posting its 18th consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth, Mosaic has also reported an average quarterly organic growth rate of 27% since 1996. Financial highlights from continuing operations(x) for this quarter include: - Revenues at $171.8 million - up 89% or $80.7 million from Q1 2000. ""Mosaic has consistently outpaced the growth of its peers within an industry that is clearly expanding,"" said Mike Preston, Chairman and CEO Mosaic Group Inc. ""We have posted 18 consecutive quarters of continued growth while adding to our blue chip client list. We are building our business by taking our clients' business farther every time we deal with them. Our organic growth comes not only from securing new client wins, but from the cross-selling wins that are characteristic of a mature company able to leverage a robust and diverse range of service offerings."" New Client Wins In the first quarter of 2001, Mosaic's newly acquired business unit Paradigm, has secured new client business worth between $20 million and $25 million a year in revenue. Combined with new client wins from Mosaic's other business units, and increases in spending from some existing clients, Mosaic has made significant progress in closing its new business gap for 2001. New Power --------- During the first quarter of 2001, Paradigm signed a contract with New Power to acquire residential and commercial customers through a variety of direct response channels such as outbound telemarketing, inbound telemarketing, direct mail and ""feet on the street"". New Power was formed by Enron Corp., the largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas in North America. Paradigm had previously provided contract marketing services to New Power. Through diligent effort, Paradigm was able to expand the contract to include the performance-based customer acquisition component. /For further information: Please Contact: Clint Becker, Chief Financial Officer, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4275, email: Donna Cox-Davies, Director of Communications, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4279, Email: 16:10 ET European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return 2001-05-03 08:52 (New York) European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return London, May 3 (Bloomberg) -- European telephone companies such as British Telecommunications Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG have improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks, making their bonds a buy, investors said. ``Sentiment seems to be changing,'' said Anna Lees-Jones, who helps manage about 28 billion pounds ($40 billion) of corporate bonds at M&G Investment Management. ``I've been building up my telecoms position all year.'' British Telecom's 10-year euro-denominated bonds sold in January yield about 214 basis points more than government debt, down from a record 238 in March. Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month, according to Enron Corp., which trades the derivatives. Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV, after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares. Phone companies sold $100 billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services. British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co. and Spain's Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for 4.8 billion pounds. British Telecom may also sell as much as 7.5 billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a so-called rights offer, according to Legal & General Group Plc, one of the company's shareholders. Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television, and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA, Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick said last week. KPN, the biggest Dutch phone company, said on March 26 it plans to raise at least 5 billion euros from asset sales to lower debt. Those plans have helped shift investors' perceptions of the companies' creditworthiness, money managers said. `Drastic Measures' ``At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from single-A to triple- B,'' said Peter Harvey, who helps run about $8.6 billion at F&C Management. ``Drastic measures such as deeply-discounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their single-A status.'' The gap, or spread, between British Telecom's sterling denominated bonds maturing in 2006, and U.K. five-year government bonds has narrowed 50 basis points to 109 basis points in the past month. Spreads between Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent five- year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed 35 basis points to 107 in April. Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enron's bankruptcy swaps, where prices have fallen in the past month, said Simon Brooks, a trader at Enron. Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event. The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to 66 basis points from 96 on April 1, Enron said. Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to 78 from 100, while KPN's fell to 135 from 183. Over the same period, France Telecom SA's declined to 70 from 100 and Telecom Italia SpA's fell to 94 from 119. British Telecom's bond yields may fall further relative to government debt, analysts said. They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc, which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook. While both companies have five-year euro-denominated bonds, British Telecom's offer 55 basis points more yield. The rivals also both have bonds maturing in 2004, and Vodafone's yield about 23 basis points fewer. ``If BT retains their rating, their spreads should be probably 20 to 30 basis points narrower,'' said Brian Venables, head of credit strategy at WestLB. ``Even though it has performed extremely well this year, there is much greater potential for BT's debt.'' Debt Reduction Target Both Moody's Investors Service, which rates British Telecom ``A2'', and Standard & Poor's, which rates it ``A'', have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year. The company's asset sales to Vodafone are ``definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment,'' said Aidan Fisher, who rates British Telecom for Moody's. In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale, ``that would meet the target they set themselves this year -- that's quite a lot to achieve in a 12 month period.'' British Telecom has said it wants to slash its 30 billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts. Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debt-reduction plans, ``the world and his wife were underweight'' telecom bonds in March, said Harvey at F&C. The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral, from underweight, relative to its benchmark, he said. Bond yields ``were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market,'' said Lees-Jones at M&G. Now, ``they have come in quite a bit and will come in further.'' --Tom Kohn and Alice James in the London newsroom (44-20) 7330 7929 or at tkohn@bloomberg.net, with reporting by Christine Harper /zls Story illustration: {CRED <GO>} to see credit analysis on Bloomberg. {BRITEL <Corp> <GO>} for BT's bonds. {DT <Corp> <GO>} for Deutsche Telekom's bonds. UK:Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives, among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments, to hedge the risk their debtors won't pay up, market participants said on Thursday. Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt. They are mainly used by banks, hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting. Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments. The market remains small, with only around a dozen non-financial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present. But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options. ""We see (corporate use) as a big growth area for credit derivatives, maybe the biggest,"" says Bryan Seyfried, vice-president of Enron Credit in London. Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp. to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other non-financial corporates. Ralf Lierow, director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich, said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack. Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives, too, he added. ""This is not a trading book thing. For us, the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management,"" Lierow said. HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group. It first started using credit derivatives in July 2000. Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time. The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business. ""The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business,"" Lierow said. Siemens uses credit default swaps, the most liquid type of credit derivatives, to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis. As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time, the company tries to match this with default swap positions. Hence, if a customer fails to pay, Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller. Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently. ""There are occasional corporate users that have secured one-off requirements for balance-sheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction,"" said Walter Gontarek, head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities. By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying, a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible, dealers said. NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates' adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years. A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court. However, traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future. Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains, in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a pay-out in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtor's failure to pay. ""We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs. You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables,"" Lierow said. These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative. Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives. There is little experience of the instruments, which are barely a decade old, in the corporate world. Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets, hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin. Clive Banks, UK head of derivatives sales to buy-side clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved. ""It's about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces,"" he said. OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool. Lierow said that Siemens, which currently only buys credit protection, planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months. He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures, and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the company's activities are concentrated. ""You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals,"" he said. Allegheny Energy buys three power plants 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has purchased three power plants from Houston-based Enron Corp. The company said it issued more than 14 million shares of common stock worth $667 million to pay for the transaction. The plants are in Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. The Midwestern purchase will bring an additional 1,710 megawatts on line. The company is expected to own 14,000 megawatts of generating power by 2005. Allegheny also has plans to build natural gas-fired facilities in Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which supplies electricity and natural gas to 3 million people in Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.

The acquisition gives Allegheny Energy more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005 and marks a significant step in the Company's strategic course toward becoming a national energy supplier. Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy Supply acquired 83 MW of coal-fired generation in the Conemaugh Generating Facility near Johnstown, Pa. Additionally, the Company has announced plans to build a 1,080-MW natural gas combined-cycle plant in La Paz County, Ariz.; a 630-MW natural gas combined-cycle facility near South Bend, Ind.; and a 540-MW natural gas fired combined-cycle generating facility in Springdale, Pa. Another 220 MW of peaking capacity have already been completed in Pennsylvania. The Midwest acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity and will be accretive to Allegheny Energy's earnings in 2001, excluding transaction costs and other costs related to the integration. Yesterday, the Company issued more than 14 million shares of common stock to facilitate the transaction. Alan J. Noia, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Allegheny Energy, said, ""I am pleased to announce the closing of Allegheny Energy's largest generation acquisition to date. It provides our Company with significant generation presence and capability as an energy merchant to sell electricity from efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities in more areas of the country with a growing demand for energy."" Output from the three facilities will be marketed by Allegheny Energy Global Markets. ""These premium generating assets are designed for operation in times of peak electricity demand,"" said Noia. ""Because of its national presence, Allegheny Energy Global Markets will be able to market the output from these newly acquired facilities in a wide variety of ways with our portfolio of existing assets and other supply arrangements so that overall operational efficiency and shareholder value is maximized."" Allegheny Energy Supply's newly acquired facilities include: the Gleason, Tenn., plant (546 MW), approximately 40 miles north of Jackson, Tenn.; the Wheatland, Ind., plant (508 MW), approximately 70 miles northeast of Evansville, Ind.; and the Lincoln Energy Center plant (656 MW) in Manhattan, Ill., near Chicago. These assets give Allegheny Energy Supply additional generating capacity within the East Central Area Reliability region (ECAR) and initial generation sources in the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC). Salomon Smith Barney acted as financial advisor and Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue acted as legal counsel for Allegheny Energy for the acquisition.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney's utility analysts sharply cut their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the U.S. in 2002 and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year. The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gas-fired power in 2003 to $3.98 a megawatt-hour from $8.73/MWh, a 54% difference from their last forecast in February. They lowered their power price index for 2002 by 1.5% and for 2003 by 7.1% Thursday in a published report. Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas. ""Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time, while power prices drop off,"" senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors. As a result, stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp. (AES), Mirant (MIR), Calpine Corp. (CPN) and NRG Energy (NRG) could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports, the Salomon report says. ""Investors may still shy away from asset and investment-heavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve,"" the report warns. After this summer, the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum, Salomon expects. These ""energy merchant"" companies, such as Enron Corp. (ENE), Williams Cos. (WMB), Duke Energy (DUK) and Dynegy (DYN), should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in non-summer months, according to Salomon. ""We expect (annual trading) volumes to grow, industry-wide, between 25% and 40%, on average, during 2001-03, as the $800 billion global energy commodity market continues to open,"" the report predicts. The overall electricity price trend is national, according to Salomon. The report, titled ""Power Curve,"" expects 2001 wholesale power prices to exceed last year's by 131% in the West and by 34% on average in the eastern U.S., including Texas. But since their last forecast, the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in 10 of 11 regional power pools. ""Interestingly, the exception to that is the New York Power Pool,"" Niles told investors. For the remainder of this year, however, Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last year's breakthrough results. ""About 50% of the spike upward in western U.S. power prices the past six months has been from something we've never seen before in this industry: political and credit risk,"" Niles said in the conference. Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the ""unholy mess in California,"" Niles said, but that won't last forever. ""Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight, that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets, and bring down profitability for the group,"" Niles said. National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector, even though reregulation won't happen. Further, in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants, transmission lines and gas pipelines, they could also extend the current period of extremely high earnings, according to the report. In non-western states, the greatest profitability from power generation for the next two years is seen in New England. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com Fitch Affs Northern Border; Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Fitch has affirmed its `BBB+' senior debt rating for Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NBP) and its `A-` senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co. (NBPL). The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative. The rating action was taken after a review of NBP's recent acquisitions and long-term business plan. A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw, LLC, Midwestern Gas Transmission Company, and Dynegy Canada midstream assets. An additional $125-150 million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down short-term debt and complete the permanent financing. The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBP's demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative long-term financing and operating strategies. Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed 50/50, debt/equity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile. Moreover, management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its non-regulated gas operations. For example, processing contracts for Bear Paw's four processing facilities are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have been 90% hedged by NBP through 2001, limiting downside exposure. NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market, operating, and financial characteristics that are consistent with its current `A-` rating. The company is a low-cost transporter of Canadian gas into the Midwest, with costs per hundred miles of less than 4 cents per mcf. The December 2000 completion of the Alliance Pipeline has had minimal impact on Northern Border as capacity utilization approaches 100%. Pipeline capacity is 99% subscribed through mid-September 2003. Its shippers are financially strong customers with uniform take-or-pay contracts. The company has never written off a bad debt. NBPL should generate EBITDA/interest coverage of nearly 4.0 times over the next few years. Credit concerns primarily relate to NBP's changing business mix and the expectation of increased market risk associated with its growing midstream operations as compared with the stable, low-risk profile of NBPL. While projected consolidated and stand alone credit measures at NBP remain relatively strong, there will be less predictability in the future cash stream utilized to service debt. NBP is a publicly traded master limited partnership. Its primary holding is a 70% economic interest in NBPL, a 1,214-mile FERC regulated interstate pipeline transporting natural gas from the Canadian border to the upper Midwest. Enron Corp. and The Williams Companies, Inc. hold a 10.0% and 3.3% stake in NBP, respectively, with the remainder publicly held. Enron controls an 82.5% stake in the management committee of NBP with Williams holding the remaining management allocation.

NEW DELHI, May 3 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to re-negotiate a troubled $2.9 billion power project in western India. But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract, Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said in a statement. ""As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week,"" the DPC statement said. ""Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal."" DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues. ""(But) This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract,"" it added. DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months, with the state's electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity. At present, Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the DPC, of which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder, some $48 million for power. The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to re-negotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB. LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project, the single largest foreign investment in India, consists of two phases, the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1,444 MW plant that is expected to be finished this year. Last week, Dabhol's board authorised the plant's managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice, which has not been issued, would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project. Earlier, a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders, who have provided millions of dollars to Houston-based Enron to build DPC are lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . If Enron pulls out of the project, the source said, the lenders would have no choice but to seek an alternative buyer. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added. India State Panel's Sat Meet With Enron Unit Postponed 05/03/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra state government's expert committee's Saturday meeting with the U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. has been postponed until May 11 at the request of DPC, a committee member told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday. The nine-member committee has been appointed to renegotiate the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's controversial power purchase agreement with DPC. The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. ""The negotiating committee's first meeting with the Dabhol Power Co. management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until May 11, 0530 GMT, at DPC's request. They (DPC) told us they wanted some more time to prepare themselves for the meeting and we have granted their request,"" said a committee member. The committee's goals are to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructure of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.com EnergieKontor Secures Enron Deal For Spain, Germany Projs 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- German wind farm developer EnergieKontor AG said Thursday it has signed a framework agreement with Enron Wind GmbH for deliveries of wind turbines for projects in Germany and Spain. In all, Enron will deliver 200 megawatts' worth of 1.5 MW turbines for onshore projects in EnergieKontor's home market and in Spain, one of its fastest-growing export markets. In addition, Neuer Markt-listed EnergieKontor said it has entered into exclusive negotiations with the local authorities for permission to build up to 15 wind farms at a number of sites in the Castilla-La Mancha region. Each site would have an installed capacity of 45-50 MW, making a total of 700 MW. ""Once we reach this stage there is about an 85-90% of the project going ahead, sometimes more,"" a spokesman told Dow Jones. EnergieKontor said it assumes that it will set up the first windfarms in Castilla-La Mancha as early as next year. -By Geoffrey T. Smith, Dow Jones Newswires; (+44 20) 7842 9260; -geoffrey.smith@dowjones.com The Bottom Line: Scottish Power Looks To Refine Focus By Andrea Chipman Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- After more than a year of lagging earnings, investment missteps and unexpected disasters, U.K. vertically-integrated utility Scottish Power (SPI) is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company. But it's got its work cut out. While investors were cheered by news that its U.S. Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage that cost the company an estimated $160 million, uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to loss-making telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus. ""It all adds up - the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of non-core businesses that they don't have any natural management flair or expertise in,"" said Brian Gallagher, a senior fund manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management, which has GBP3 million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund. ""We have a reasonably low opinion of the company."" The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 million from GBP736 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share declined to 30.65 pence in the 2001 fiscal year from 41.22 pence in 2000. The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage, competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. Although the company's shares were trading at 458.5 pence after the release of Thursday's earnings results, up from 441.5 pence Wednesday, they are down more than 15% from 533 pence a year ago. Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. ""We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that...on growing earnings across that value chain,"" Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday. ""In the U.S., we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses."" Scottish Power's move away from a full multi-utility profile - begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland - toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization. The company is also considering selling Southern Water, which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business. Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the company's overall growth strategy from Russell, who took over as chief executive last month, and other managers. The toll from months of drift, is evident, they said. Sales Of Southern Water, Thus Seen Indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its non-core ventures. Russell said his company remains ""supportive"" of Thus, which reported a 2000 fiscal year loss of GBP21.4 million this week, and has no plans to exit its remaining 50% stake in the company. Similarly, he said, Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water - which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure - although he said the company had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers. Although he declined to identify any of the bidders, Italian energy company Enel SpA (ENI) has confirmed its interest. Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely, with some bids already exceeding the GBP2 billion at which many analysts value the company's combined assets and debt. It's unclear, they said, how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. ""Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company,"" a source familiar with the company said. In a year's time, he added, ""it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company."" Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its U.S. expansion without adding to its 90% gearing levels, analysts and investors said. Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit, Portland General, but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp. Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy. ""We like their U.S. strategy where they've leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive U.K. market,"" said Gareth Lewis-Davies, head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London. Closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. ""Strategic decisions need to be made, and I'm not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not,"" said Andrew Wright, U.K. utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London. ""They are pretty much involved across the value chain, and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they specialize in, if any.""

They= =20 say the plan is full of dangerously optimistic assumptions, such as estimat= es=20 that 90% of the state's alternative energy producers will be generating=20 electricity this summer--only two-thirds are now--and that Californians wil= l=20 use 7% less electricity. ?????Although Republicans don't control either house, the emergency=20 legislation requires a two-thirds vote, which gives the GOP significant swa= y. ?????The plan from the Republican leadership would commit taxpayer money fo= r=20 the first time to an electricity problem that has only affected customers o= f=20 private utilities. Because the plan is sure to draw strong opposition from= =20 politicians in Los Angeles and other areas served by public power agencies,= =20 Republicans have included a complex, $1.5-billion proposal to provide refun= ds=20 to those served by municipal utilities. ?????By blocking the emergency legislation, Republicans may stop state=20 Treasurer Phil Angelides from securing a $4.13-billion loan to repay state= =20 coffers for electricity purchases--a failure that would reduce the money=20 available to Davis for his next budget and possibly delay his plan to resol= ve=20 the energy crisis. Angelides needs the bill to guarantee repayment for the= =20 loan. ?????If Angelides does not obtain legislative approval by Monday, he will= =20 miss a Tuesday deadline lenders had given him to close the loan. That would= =20 clearly leave Davis with less money for new education, police and=20 road-building programs as he begins planning his next budget this month. ?????Moreover, failure to pass the bill could delay a record bond issue tha= t=20 Davis promised would replenish the budget and shield it from further energy= =20 drains by summer. And it could harm sagging confidence on Wall Street that= =20 California can deliver on its plans to manage the energy crisis, Angelides= =20 said. ?????California's credit rating has already been downgraded by one credit= =20 agency, Standard & Poor's, largely because of concerns about the effect of= =20 electricity purchases on state finances. ?????Negotiations Are Continuing ?????""The Republicans appear to be digging in and playing a dangerous game = of=20 financial roulette with the state.

I just don't understand what the Republicans are=20 thinking."" ?????Said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks): ""We're not=20 prepared to give the governor a blank check."" ?????Democrats threatened Thursday to test the Republicans' resolve by=20 bringing the bill to a vote in the Assembly, but backed down. Negotiations= =20 among legislative leaders continue. ?????To avoid widespread blackouts, the state government entered the=20 electricity-buying business in January after the private utilities became t= oo=20 burdened with debt to continue purchasing power on the expensive wholesale= =20 market. ?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,= =20 the state budget is to be repaid for the power purchases through a massive= =20 municipal bond issue, expected to be the largest in American history. The= =20 bonds, in turn, are to be paid off by utility ratepayers through a slice of= =20 their monthly bills. ?????However, the plan was based on the premise that the state would quickl= y=20 bring down power costs by entering into long-term contracts with suppliers-= -a=20 scenario that has yet to materialize. ?????In fact, California's power costs have gone up since January. Lawmaker= s=20 initially estimated that $10 billion in bonds would allow the budget to be= =20 repaid and cover future power purchases. Davis is now proposing $12.5 billi= on=20 in bonds--and higher electric bills--to finance the state's costs until 200= 3. ?????Republicans are convinced that it will not be enough. They say the=20 Angelides bridge loan is not needed because the state has money in various= =20 funds that could cover power purchases well into the fall. ?????They also confess to political considerations. Republican legislators= =20 believe that by allowing Angelides to obtain his loan now, they will be=20 powerless to oppose further borrowing later. The loan Angelides set up with= =20 J.P. Morgan Chase and several other financial services companies is to be= =20 repaid with the bond issue. If the loan is not repaid by the end of the=20 summer, the interest rate will rise dramatically, a situation that would ma= ke=20 it hard for the minority Republicans to oppose more bonds. ?????The strong GOP views were shaped in part by Democratic state Controlle= r=20 Kathleen Connell, who met with Republican legislators earlier this week and= =20 shared a highly critical appraisal of Davis' plan. ?????Connell told the Republicans that the governor's strategy was based on= a=20 series of assumptions about electricity market conditions in California thi= s=20 summer that, in her view, are highly improbable. ?????""It is almost impossible for all these hypothetical situations=20 envisioned in their scenario to occur at once,"" Connell said. ?????But even if all the assumptions came to pass, she predicted that=20 California would still need to secure another source of financing by next= =20 spring to continue energy purchases. Davis administration officials have=20 rebutted her claim. ?????""I am deeply troubled by this incremental approach to this financing= =20 that is long-term in nature and is going to burden the state for many years= ,""=20 Connell said, in what appeared to be a reference to Davis' reputation as a= =20 plodder.=20 ?????Using Surplus to Pay for Electricity ?????Republicans, who have traditionally been opposed to financing public= =20 programs with large bond issues, contend that Davis needs to reevaluate his= =20 plan. By proposing to essentially forget the $5 billion the state has spent= =20 so far on power, they are advocating using up the state's projected budget= =20 surplus on electricity costs, even if it means cutting new government=20 programs. ?????""If Gov. Davis continues down this path, he could bankrupt the state,""= =20 said Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). ""That would have a far great= er=20 impact on education."" ?????Democrats, who strongly believe that the surplus should be invested in= =20 roads, schools and to meet other long-term future needs, are unlikely to ev= er=20 support the idea. Lawmakers are already discussing outflanking the=20 Republicans by drafting a bill to repay the budget on a nonemergency basis,= =20 which would only require a majority vote. ?????That, however, would probably delay the financing until at least Augus= t,=20 since nonemergency measures do not take effect for 90 days--giving Californ= ia=20 only about six weeks to cut the largest municipal bond deal ever before sta= te=20 coffers begin to empty, according to Angelides. ?????There is another potential consequence: Many of the long-term contract= s=20 the Davis administration has reached to purchase electricity contain clause= s=20 that may make them void if the state does not obtain financing by July. ?????""This is a very dangerous game,"" Angelides said. ?????In other electricity developments Thursday: ?????* Over Republican objections, Democrats in the state Senate approved a= nd=20 sent to Davis a far-reaching bill that would put state government in the=20 business of operating its own power plants and selling electricity at cheap= er=20 rates than private companies. The bill, SB 6x by Senate leader John Burton= =20 (D-San Francisco), would create a state power authority with the ability to= =20 finance, buy, own and build generation plants and sell the energy at=20 cost-based rates. ?????on likened the proposed government body to the New York Power Authorit= y,=20 approved by GOP Gov. George Pataki, which brought about a 10% reduction in= =20 rates. ?????The difference from the current situation is that ""the people of=20 California, the ratepayers, would benefit, and not the corporate officers a= nd=20 not the shareholders"" of private energy companies, Burton said. ?????But Republicans attacked the power authority as ""more government"" that= =20 would impose itself on an enterprise better suited for private operators wi= th=20 years of expertise. ?????""This is a horrific mistake and one that California ratepayers will be= =20 paying for many years to come,"" said state Sen.

PG&amp;E had asked the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to overrule PUC decisions that the utility was not entitled to the money, which the utility spent buying electricity on the increasingly expensive wholesale market. In dismissing the lawsuit Wednesday, Judge Ronald S.W. Lew said ``PG&amp;E's claims are not yet ripe for review,'' meaning the case wasn't ready for trial. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, declared the decision a win for California ratepayers. ``PG&amp;E was banking on winning this case and using it as one of their excuses for not negotiating with the governor. It appears at least for now they failed,'' Maviglio said. But because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds rather than merit, PG&amp;E said the door was left open for the utility to refile its action once the commission makes final its interim orders on PG&amp;E's requested rate increase. ``The court determined that our lawsuit was premature because the CPUC had not yet finalized its various decisions on PG&amp;E's request for recovery of its costs to purchase wholesale power,'' PG&amp;E said in a statement. ``Today's action allows us to continue to pursue the merits of the case on a timely basis.'' A similar federal case filed by Southern California Edison is on hold, said company spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow. Edison, the state's second-largest utility, would drop that case as part of a rescue plan negotiated by Davis, which also includes the state buying the utility's transmission lines for $2.7 billion. Since last June, the two utilities say they have lost more than $14 billion. California's 1996 deregulation law froze electricity prices for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. When prices rose to record levels over the past year, PG&amp;E was unable to recoup the higher costs from its customers' bills. The undercollection, along with a failed deal to sell its transmission lines to the state, drove PG&amp;E to file for federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 6, the company argued. On Wednesday, the parent company, PG&amp;E Corp., reported a first-quarter loss of $951 million, or $2.62 per share. The first-quarter loss follows a fourth-quarter loss of $4.1 billion that also stemmed from continuing costs in California's power crisis. Bankruptcy Update/ PG&E Files Motion to Require CAISO to Follow Federal Law SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation - Pacific Gas and Electric Company has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court asking the court to direct the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to comply with bankruptcy law, its Tariff, and a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruling, and stop billing the utility for wholesale power purchased. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's motion, which includes a request for a preliminary injunction, asks the court to enjoin the CAISO from requiring the utility to pay costs the CAISO has incurred and continues to incur to purchase wholesale power on its behalf, unless the utility can fully recover these costs. Bankruptcy law imposes an automatic stay to prevent parties from making certain claims or taking certain actions that would interfere with the estate or property of the estate of a Chapter 11 debtor. By purchasing power at costs higher than existing retail prices, and then sending the bill to the utility, the CAISO is violating the automatic stay provision and could be reducing the value of the company's assets by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars per month, depending on the average retail rate, the wholesale price, and the amount of power purchased by the CAISO. Recently, the CAISO sent Pacific Gas and Electric Company a bill for January and February spot market purchases that totaled nearly $1 billion. The action alleges that requiring the utility to pay more than it can collect in its existing generation-related rates would be improper under federal Bankruptcy Code because it is not in the best interest of the estate, would be an unauthorized post-petition use of Pacific Gas and Electric Company's property, and would force the utility to undertake credit on onerous terms. In addition, on April 6, 2001, FERC ordered the CAISO to comply with its February 14 order, in which FERC ordered that the CAISO could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities. Both Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company are no longer creditworthy companies. By continuing to purchase power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the CAISO is in violation of its own Tariff, FERC orders, and federal law.

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE service. The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now. We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU, and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues. We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together. Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar. This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance. We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress. A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me). I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask. If timing is bad for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative.

Emshwiller Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 05/22/2001 The Wall Street Journal A2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable price gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price fixing a felony, and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey,'"" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay ""is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response."" Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above ""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc., and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. Generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. ""Plants have been running flat out,"" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. ""Clearly, something is going on here."" However, he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee ""indicated"" to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was ""counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature"" in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" --- Journal Link: What is California doing to alleviate the energy crisis? See a video report of California State Treasurer Philip Angelides discussing the state's plans, in the online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks. --- Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission INVESTIGATION: Whether generators are charging more than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act; whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity.

Business/Financial Desk; Section W Enron Unit Moves to End India Contract For Power By SARITHA RAI 05/22/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 6 c. 2001 New York Times Company BANGALORE, India, May 21 -- Fed up with its main customer's refusal to pay its bills, the Enron Corporation's Indian power-generating venture served formal notice on Saturday that it would terminate its power supply contract and pull out. The move by the Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron, starts the clock ticking on a six-month notice period before the contract is voided, during which negotiations to settle the dispute are expected. The $2.9 billion Dabhol project represents the largest single foreign investment in India. Separately, Enron said today that it was withdrawing from a pipeline project in Qatar, which would have supplied some gas to Dabhol. The company said that the two steps were unrelated. The Dabhol project has been the subject of a series of wrangles between the company and the governments of India and of the western Indian state of Maharashtra. The state-owned utility company that contracted to buy power from the Dabhol plant has defaulted on some $64 million in unpaid power bills, and has accused Dabhol of charging too much. Dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the termination notice after both governments failed to honor their contractual commitments to buy and pay for its output. But in a statement issued over the weekend, Dabhol said it was ''still open to constructive discussion on the solutions.'' The company said a ''lasting and feasible solution'' to the dispute would require that the two governments either honor their obligations to buy Dabhol's power or find other creditworthy buyers to take the power instead. The first phase of the project now generates 740 megawatts of power, and the second phase, adding another 1,444 megawatts of capacity, is scheduled to go on line next month. Under the contract, the termination that Enron has set in motion would oblige the federal and state governments to pay damages to Enron and the lenders that financed the project, possibly as much as $500 million -- the value of a year's output of power plus the project's $300 million in debt -- if it is shut down.

California; Metro Desk The State GOP Criticizes Davis' Choice of PR Aides Capitol: Legislative leaders call the pair political operatives who are too partisan to represent the state during energy crisis. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER 05/22/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-8 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- Republican legislative leaders Monday blasted Gov. Gray Davis' decision to spend $30,000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as ""cut-throat,"" Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring ""undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis."" Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30,000 a month for at least the next six months. ""We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll,"" Brulte said in an interview. ""Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest."" Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ""California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,"" the letter said. Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will ""serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators."" ""The Republicans,"" Lehane added, ""ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here."" Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ""There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,"" Davis' campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. Davis emerged from the meeting saying ""the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout."" It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. * Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

EUROPE/MIDEAST Insurer Storebrand Favors Sampo's Bid Over Den Norske Norway's largest insurer, Storebrand, became the center of a bidding war between Finnish financial-services company Sampo and Norway's Den Norske Bank, with Storebrand favoring Sampo. Sampo's offer values Storebrand at 20.8 billion Norwegian kroner ($2.3 billion), compared with DnB's 17.6 billion kroner bid, as the Nordic region's top financial companies battle for position in a consolidating sector. Sampo and Storebrand, in a joint Helsinki news conference, said they were confident their deal would succeed. Sampo's cash-and-stock offer, valued at 75 kroner a share, represents a 31% premium to Storebrand's average share price during the past month and was backed by Storebrand's management. DnB wouldn't say whether it would alter its bid. ""One cannot count on that,"" its chairman said. HypoVereinsbank Results Disappoint Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank, Germany's second-largest bank, known as HypoVereinsbank, said first-quarter pretax profit rose 25% from a year earlier to 770 million euros ($678 million), below analysts' consensus forecast of 795 million euros. Profit rose 63% to 468 million euros; earnings and pretax profit were both helped by one-time gains of 454 million euros. Operating profit fell 59% in the retail-banking division to 98 million euros, and was down 43% in the international-markets division to 184 million euros. HypoVereinsbank said tough market conditions world-wide reduced regular commission and interest income. Enron Pulls Out of Emirates Gas Project U.S. energy company Enron has decided to pull out of the multibillion-dollar Dolphin natural-gas project, selling its 24.5% stake to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, or UOG, according to Dolphin Energy's managing director, Ahmed Al-Sayigh. He didn't specify the reason for Enron's withdrawal or the value of Enron's stake. The Dolphin project agreement, reached two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, aims to bring two billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field in the Persian Gulf to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and France's TotalFinaElf each held a 24.5% stake, with UOG owning the remaining 51%. Mr. Sayigh said UOG will hold discussions with other companies on a possible sale of Enron's original stake. Richard Bergester, manager for Enron Middle East, said that having contributed to the project's initial stages, Enron now feels it can't ""add"" any more. He didn't elaborate. A TotalFinaElf official said it is interested in a greater stake in Dolphin.

By Narayanan Madhavan 05/22/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BANGALORE, India, May 22 (Reuters) - India's technology state of Karnataka, spurred by a payments row involving U.S. power developer Enron Corp in a neighbouring province, has reopened sealed power purchase deals with 11 private firms. The southern state's government has told independent power producers (IPPs), which are yet to start generation, that they need to make their tariffs more competitive, officials said. ""Now it (electricity) cannot be at any cost,"" V.P. Baligar, chairman and managing director of the Karnataka State Power Transmission Corp Ltd (KPTCL), the state's monopoly power distributor, told Reuters in an interview late on Monday. The move comes on the heels of the bitter wrangle in Maharashtra state involving Dabhol Power Co, 65-percent owned by Houston-based Enron. Dabhol issued a preliminary notice on Saturday to end a contract to sell power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The step came after Maharashtra ceased payments saying Dabhol's tariffs were too high. The $2.9-billion project, which is 90-percent complete, was first billed as a showcase of India's decade-old reform programme but now is regarded by critics as a symbol of policy bungling. ""Enron is a lesson for all of us,"" Baligar said. Karnataka also said it would not provide financial assurances in the form of escrow cover and government loan guarantees which the firms wanted to help sweeten lending rates. ""We're trying to tell them your tariff has to be competitive,"" Baligar said, but added that the state was open to negotiations. ""You have to have the final capability so you can implement the project without any guarantee or escrow."" SIGNED DEALS Five years ago, the state signed power purchase deals with 14 private firms. Three of them are already generating power at rates higher than the state would now like to pay. They will continue to get these rates but the 11 unbuilt units face an uncertain future. The 11 plants involve 2,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity, half of which would be supplied by the Mangalore Power Co (MPC) from which U.S.-based Cogentrix exited in 1999, citing litigation and delays in government approval. China Light & Power now owns the company, in which India's Tata group is expected to take 30 percent. MPC Managing Director V.P. Sharma told Reuters that his firm's project would not be hit by the demand for lower tariffs because it was based on coal unlike the Enron project, based on naphtha. ""Our cost is the lowest cost approved (and) coal prices have fallen (since the agreement),"" Sharma told Reuters from Bombay. Company officials say the project is also looking forward to a federal guarantee to help it move forward. Baligar said the government's intention was to weed out those who are not serious. ""Those who are serious can sit with us and sort out their problems,"" he said. Power tariffs vary, depending upon foreign exchange rates and the type and prices of fuels. Three projects which are already generating power get about 3.0 to 4.0 rupees (6.4 to 8.5 U.S. cents) per unit. The 11 uninstalled plants had comparable rates but MPC says falling coal prices helped its competitiveness. One generating firm, Jindal Tractabel, which uses coal and gas, gets about 2.60 rupees. Its purchase agreement was not among the 14 and is awaiting regulatory approval. The state wants the Jindal rate to be the benchmark for reopened agreements. If private firms cut capital costs and work out long-term fuel supplies, they will be able to cut rates, Baligar said. The state says it needs 4,000 MW of new capacity over 10 years and 2,500 MW over five years. State-run utilities are in a position to meet five-year needs at low rates, Baligar said. Asked if Karnataka could face litigation over the reopening of the contracts, Baligar had legally strong arguments. ( $1 = 46.9 rupees). Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. INDIA: India utility may slap 4bln rupee fine on Enron unit. 05/22/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY, May 22 (Reuters) - An Indian utility is planning to impose a second penalty of four billion rupees ($85 million) on Enron's local unit, barely a week after the U.S. energy giant took its first step to pull out of the embattled project. A senior official at the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) said on Tuesday the fine on Dabhol Power Company (DPC) was for not meeting capacity targets within a stipulated period. ""We will do this as soon as the bill for May is received next month,"" the official told Reuters. DPC officials declined to comment on the matter. Earlier this year, MSEB had imposed a similar penalty on DPC - which DPC has not paid - saying its plant could not be ramped up to full capacity within three hours from a cold start. Enron and MSEB have been battling for six months over payment defaults and last week DPC, owned 65 percent by Enron, issued a preliminary notice to terminate a power purchase agreement - widely seen as a move that would lead to a pull out. According to DPC, it is owed $48 million by MSEB. A top government official told Reuters in Delhi on Monday the federal government is optimistic Houston-based Enron and the Maharashtra state will resolve their wrangle. The agreement signed between MSEB and DPC in 1995 stipulates that if Dabhol's plant cannot achieve 100 percent capacity within three hours from restart, MSEB is entitled to impose a penalty. The MSEB official said the plant had failed to fulfil this condition in February and March, considered peak periods for power demand by the utility. DPC is building a $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW plant, of which the first phase of 740 MW began operations in May 1999. Enron is India's largest foreign investor. ($1=47.0 Indian rupees).

Power corrupts... 05/22/2001 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) APROPOS of Enrons notice to the government of Maharashtra, Mumbai should act pragmatically instead of indulging in heroics and rhetoric. It should set its own house in order, improve MSEBs functioning and quickly privatise. If it fails to do these its threat to Enron will also be taken as just another case of demanding kickbacks. IT is sad really that Enron had to issue its pre-termination notice. We should now ask whether MSEB would be able to construct such a project in record time. Corruption is rampant in MSEB. They may say Enron power is not needed, but you cannot even get a new connection easily. Interruptions are commonplace in rural areas (sometimes up to four times a week). Power thefts are commonplace too. Each day, on average, we pay MSEB about Rs 6 per unit for commercial connections. But most people would be willing to pay Rs 7 or so if they got clean, uninterrupted power. We have seen, for example, the vast cost overruns of many of the official water management projects. These overruns go up to 20 times, with delays stretching up to 10 years with no guarantee no results even then. All told, the government is sending very wrong signals to the international community by raking up the Enron controversy. It should set its own house in order. THE new state ministries are too big in size West Bengals in particular. It has allotted one minister just to deal with fire brigades. The expenditure in lakhs it entails could exceed the total number of fire tenders under the department. Despite that it needed 7 complete days to control a recent fire (with private tankers requisitioned to help over and above the ones owned by the corporation and municipalities). We need more fire tenders, not ministers or those who are associated with the big boss. Also we need a new minister, plus a full-fledged department, to examine corrupt practices in local government and also in the central government offices located in states. Meanwhile, was the Sarkaria Commissions recommendation to restrict the size of the ministry to within 10 per cent of the size of the Assembly advanced only to be flouted? We should call a stop to such commissions as not even 10 per cent of their purpose is served; they too entail huge establishments which are maintained year after year at taxpayer expense. SINCE 1993, I have been familiar with the political, social and business scenarios in the US and so I feel reasonably qualified to make some observations on US immigration policy by Sudhir Shah. Shahs statistics are not totally accurate but they depict the `global picture. The Indian immigrants (a million plus now) are, in many respects, a class apart. Their education levels are far higher than those of other immigrants, many of whom are just a grade above our rag-pickers (they are the cherry and berry pickers on US farms). I have not come across a single uneducated Indian in the US since 1983. Even in asset-formation, Indians (even Pakistanis) are leagues ahead of the other immigrants. B T Dasture, Mumbai - Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Godbole findings Our Editorial 05/22/2001 Business Standard 15 Copyright (c) Business Standard The Godbole committee's first report, submitted on 10 April, is an eye-opener to what can only be called a massive scandal. It leaves several players MSEB, successive Maharashtra governments, the Kirit Parikh re-negotiation exercise, the Central Electricity Authority, and other players in New Delhi with no clothes on. MSEB claimed that it had negotiated a tariff that was lower than would result from applying the central government's standard formula. But this was patently fraudulent, because the comparison was based on wrong numbers, incorrect technical parameters and unequal assumptions (one rupee-dollar rate for the Dabhol tariff, another for calculating the government formula), all of it designed to establish what was not true. Asked in court why there had been no competitive bidding, the answer (believe it or not) was that MSEB was not competent to handle competitive bidding. But it was so wonderfully capable of handling direct tariff negotiations that it eventually gave Dabhol a higher tariff than Enron had initially sought, before the negotiations began! That's only for starters. There is much more in the Godbole report. On the basis of a passing comment in an FIPB meeting, that the project's costs were broadly in line with other similar projects, the power secretary in New Delhi tells the Central Electricity Authority that the CEA's techno-economic clearance is not required though this is statutorily mandated. The CEA agrees to this untenable proposition, but later issues a vaguely worded clearance on the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the Godbole committee. The re-gasification project that was made part of the power project had a capacity to handle 5 million tonnes, though Dabhol itself needed only 2.1 million tonnes. A port facility had similar excess capacity. Yet the entire cost of these facilities was loaded on to Dabhol, along with the full cost of the 20-year gas supply contract. Thus, as the Godbole committee observes, what should have been a variable cost was converted to part of the fixed cost, which MSEB would have to service through a capacity charge, whether any power or gas was bought or not. Even the power requirements of Maharashtra were mis-calculated in order to over-ride a warning from the World Bank that the Dabhol power would not be needed. This was done by assuming that industrial demand for power would grow overnight at twice the earlier rate, and that MSEB itself would overnight see a dramatic worsening of its operating parameters. There is still more in the report, but the point should be obvious. What the report shows is that the Dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test (as in fact two members of the Godbole committee recommend), on the grounds that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense. If a favourable judicial decision becomes possible, that should help mitigate the costs of winding up a truly scandalous project. For reasons that are not clear, MSEB and the Maharashtra government have chosen not to go down this route. Perhaps they have greater and continuing faith in the re-negotiation process. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. SMARTMONEY.COM: Power Grab By Elizabeth Harris 05/21/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Feeling squeezed by rising electricity bills and shrinking investment returns? Consider investing in utilities, which posted solid gains amid the recent bear-market carnage. But plugging into this volatile sector is risky business, as anyone who piled in this year based on energy's surge in 2000 can testify. After returning 7.28% last year as demand for power outstripped supply, the average utilities fund is so far down 1% through May 18, according to the fund research firm Morningstar. Though the sector's prospects remain attractive, such volatility is par for the course, says Mark Beckwith, portfolio manager of the Vanguard Utilities Income fund (VGSUX). Utilities and funds that focus on the sector no longer perform like bonds, delivering most of the gains via relatively predictable dividend yields. Instead, the industry has greater growth prospects (and the correspondingly higher potential for losses) tied to the fluctuating demand for power. Already, high prices for natural gas and electricity have created incentives for producers to boost supplies. And the stodgy local monopolies that once dominated the industry must now reckon with a bevy of independent producers, distributors and traders. Even telecom companies are now considered fair game, offering managers of sector funds fresh choices alongside greater risk. ""The classification of a utility has changed,"" Beckwith says. At the same time, the crisis gripping electricity-starved California is showing other states the pitfalls to avoid as they deregulate their grids. ""The outlook for wiser deregulation is very much with us,"" says Bill Reaves, a manager of the Strong American Utilities fund (SAMUX). The crisis out west has also spurred construction of new power plants from New York to Florida, he adds. Managers also count on continued political support from the former oilmen in the White House who are determined to boost domestic output. With such inducements in mind, we screened Morningstar's database looking for no-load utilities portfolios with one-year returns of at least 1% and three-year annualized returns of 5% or more. We also sought funds with initial investment minimums no higher than $3,000 and expense ratios below the category's average. Strong American Utilities Bill Reaves, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities fund, characterizes the $290 million portfolio's positions as ""real utilities."" ""We try to concentrate in the electric and natural-gas area,"" Reaves says. ""We try to concentrate in holdings and companies where we see good growth."" Last year, that meant scaling back significantly from telecom stocks, in part because of a deteriorating outlook. Right now, electric utilities represent 44.5% of the fund - and Dominion Resources (D) is the largest position. Energy ranging from gas utilities to integrated oil and gas companies has also been a significant holding, at 24.2%. Reaves and the rest of the portfolio management team are also very sensitive to valuations. The portfolio consists of 40 stocks, but the managers can devote up to 75% of the fund's assets to the 16 to 18 companies seen as the best bargains. This cautious approach has stood the fund well at a time when some of its competitors got hit by telecoms' travails. The Strong portfolio rose 27.33% in 2000 and is up 2.42% so far this year, contributing to a 15.18% three-year record. Reaves expects the good times to last, with industry earnings growth on the order of 8% to 10% coupled with dividends of about 5% over the next three to five years. ""Demand is likely to keep on being strong...and the value of the service is going to be appreciated a great deal more,"" Reaves says. For example, the electric utilities' average price-to-earnings ratio for 2002 is about 12 - roughly a 50% discount to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The minimum investment is $2,500, and the portfolio bears a 1% expense ratio. Vanguard Utilities Income ""We won't be moving with the Nasdaq,"" says portfolio manager Beckwith of the Vanguard Utilities Income fund he runs. Beckwith invests a relatively small 17% slice of the $900 million fund in telecom stocks. As with the other funds in this screen, such caution paid off last year, when the fund gained 18.7%. That turned the tables on 1999, when the technology boom consigned Vanguard Utilities to the rear echelon of its peer group. Annualized over three years, the portfolio has returned 9.33%, trailing the average utilities' fund's 10.53%. Here, too, the emphasis is on attractive valuations. Beckwith also has a mandate to invest at least 95% of the portfolio in dividend-paying utilities (last year, all assets had to be invested in such stocks.) ""I'm going to get as much growth as I can without taking on too much risk,"" Beckwith says. Right now, Beckwith has 61% of his assets in defensive electric utilities such as Dominion Resources or the FPL Group (FPL). The portfolio is down 2.65% so far this year, but Beckwith, too, is counting on continued strong demand for electricity. ""Earnings momentum will be very good for the group at least over the next year,"" he says. His main concern is that high energy prices could encourage conservation, eventually depressing demand. The investment threshold is $3,000, and the expense ratio is a slim 0.38%. American Gas Index fund This concentrated portfolio rises and falls with the gas industry's prospects. Strong natural-gas prices boosted the American Gas Index fund's (GASFX) return last year to a 55.86%, far above the sector's average. That more than offset the 3.71% drop in 1999. Annualized over three years, the roughly $300 million fund has gained 15.82%. Like other index portfolios, the fund doesn't make stock picks; instead it owns 73 members of the American Gas Association, representing much of the gas distribution and transmission industry in most U.S. regions. Stocks are weighted by market-cap and by the portion of a company's assets involved in natural gas. Top holdings include Williams Companies (WMB), Enron (ENE) and Duke Energy (DUK). The initial investment is $2,500, and expenses are 0.85%.

Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute 2001-05-22 06:32 (New York) Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute Kuala Lumpur, May 22 (Bloomberg) -- Malaysia LNG Tiga Sdn. may have to find new buyers for as much as 2.6 million metric tons a year of liquefied natural gas if Dabhol Power Co. carries through termination of electricity supplies to India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board. MLNG Tiga has an agreement to deliver a maximum 2.6 million tons a year of LNG each year to an import terminal Enron is building to feed the Dabhol power plant. Saturday, Dabhol Power, 65 percent owned by Enron Corp. of the U.S., started a procedure to end its power supply contract to the electricity board, its sole customer, which owes over 3 billion Indian rupees ($64 million) in unpaid power bills. ``It is our hope that matters in India would be resolved,'' said Azman Ibrahim, spokesman for state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd., which owns 60 percent of MLNG Tiga. ``If they do not work out, we would have to find or make alternative arrangements.'' MLNG Tiga is constructing Malaysia's third gas export facility, which will raise the country's LNG capacity to 23 million tons from about 16 million tons in 2000. If Dabhol goes through with cancellation of its power supply contract, MLNG Tiga would have to find buyers for more than a third of the 6.8 million tons it is adding to Malaysia's output capacity. Other partners in MLNG Tiga are the Sarawak state government with a 10 percent share, Royal Dutch/Shell Group's unit Shell Gas BV with 15 percent, Nippon Oil LNG (Netherlands) BV with 10 percent and Diamond Gas Netherlands BV with 5 percent. The plant is due to be completed at the end of 2002 with commercial production due to begin in 2003. India's federal and state governments may have to pay Dabhol Power Co. more than 170 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) if the Enron Corp. unit cancels its 2,184 megawatt power venture. LEADER: India unplugged Financial Times; May 22, 2001 The latest threat from Enron, the US energy group, to pull out of its Dabhol power plant venture near Bombay illustrates both the shambolic nature of India's electricity system and the wider risks of investing in the country. The project had serious drawbacks. But unless energy companies can expect a commercial return, they will not invest in badly needed new infrastructure. Unless contracts are honoured, few foreign companies will consider India as a place to do business. The Maharashtra state electricity board, the Dabhol plant's only customer, is refusing to pay its bills, arguing that the tariffs are unjustifiably inflated. Prices are certainly high. The plant, fuelled by expensive naphtha, is running way below capacity due to unexpectedly low demand, further increasing unit costs. More difficult to judge is whether this is within the terms of the contract, since Enron is keeping the details confidential. The argument over unit costs, though, is in any case less relevant than it might seem as most of India's state electricity boards, including Maharashtra's, operate at a large loss. Many consumers pay highly subsidised rates. Many pay nothing. Bills go uncollected. Half of Delhi's electricity output is stolen, mostly to power middle-class air conditioners rather than light bulbs for the poor. Bankrupt state utilities are then periodically bailed out to the detriment of spending on health and education. India's state authorities urgently need to introduce a common minimum tariff and a more targeted form of subsidy. This may be unpopular, but the central government's offer of Dollars 5.6bn, raised via a bond issue, to pay off the electricity boards' debts should sweeten the pill. A new pricing regime is only the first step. Electricity generation, transmission and distribution should be unbundled and privatised. Contracts should be awarded through competition, not by arrangement with the relevant political party. This would require much more transparency than many of India's politicians have been ready to concede. Enron's difficulties over the Dabhol plant, the largest foreign investment in India, have persuaded other western companies to withdraw from similar projects. This will hardly help the country to overcome the power shortages that hinder economic development. But the effect will reverberate well beyond the energy sector. India receives a pitifully small slice of the world's foreign direct investment. Infrastructure weaknesses are certainly one factor. But as important is the readiness of Indian politicians to manipulate foreign business for their own ends. Copyright: The Financial Times Limited May 22, 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's waters By LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron Corp. is pulling out of a large natural gas project off Qatar, the company said Monday. Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to work with Elf, a subsidiary of France's TotalFinaElf, and the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qatar North Field. More than a year ago those involved with the project said it could end up requiring investments of up to $10 billion over six or seven years. Enron said Monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, which said in a news release it had started negotiating with other international players to become stakeholders. With the transfer, United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will own 75.5 percent of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released. Enron pulled out for a couple reasons, including that it believes there are better places to invest its money, said Alex Parsons, a company spokesman in London. The project doesn't necessarily fit with Enron's current focus. It is emphasizing businesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale markets such as those for natural gas, electricity and broadband. Enron said it would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group that were ""in line with our core business activities."" M. Carol Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, said Enron's move is consistent with its exit strategy from international assets that generate low returns. May 22, 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron exploring commodity trading Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle News Services NEW YORK -- Houston-based Enron Corp., the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trading house, is looking to continue its expansion into industries beyond energy with a move into the cocoa, coffee and sugar businesses, industry sources said Monday. Enron has had conversations and interviews with members of the commodity trade in recent weeks, using a London-based recruitment firm to help them, the sources said. ""They are definitely interested in getting into the business. Enron has been looking for physical traders. They have some internal people and are looking for lieutenants with experience,"" a cocoa trader said. A representative of Enron's public relations department would only say that the firm is constantly investigating different markets and opportunities. ""There is always a lot of speculation about what we are doing,"" Habiba Bayi of Enron said Monday. May 22, 2001 Houston Chronicle Local and state Plains Resources gets new officers Former executives of Enron and Kinder Morgan are among those chosen for a new slate of officers at Plains Resources, an oil and gas exploration and production company that had been sharing management with Plains All American Pipeline. They are filling vacancies created by people who went over to the pipeline side, said spokeswoman Carolyn Tice. John T. Raymond, who was vice president of corporate development at Kinder Morgan and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, was appointed executive vice president and chief operating officer of Plains Resources.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable price-gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony, and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. Investigations Under Way About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' "" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay "" is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response."" Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above ""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: Agency ????Investigation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ????Whether generators are charging more than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act; whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General ????Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. PUC and California Independent System Operator ????Whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and, thus, to raise electricity prices. California Electricity Oversight Board ????Whether patterns of bidding and pricing in California's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. Sources: state and federal agencies Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. 'Forced Outage' Rate Rises Generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. ""Plants have been running flat out,"" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. ""Clearly, something is going on here."" However, he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee ""indicated"" to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was ""counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature"" in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" Write to John R.

Now California has power watches and power warnings to guide residents through days of summer blackouts. ??Beginning next week, forecasters who look at variables like electricity loads and transmission constraints instead of wind speeds and barometric pressure will lay the odds of blackouts being imposed the next day. If those odds appear to be 50-50 or greater, they will issue a power warning. ??In addition, the California Independent System Operator will issue 30-minute advisories to warn state residents that blackouts are probably imminent. ??The new warnings are in response to complaints that blackouts have taken people by surprise. ??""What we're hearing from the public is they wanted a little more heads-up when it comes to blackouts,"" said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. ??Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis was in Chicago Monday to hear firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. State lawmakers are exploring ways to provide Californians with greater notice of potential blackouts, including scheduling them in advance. ??In Chicago, where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers, residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming, and grid operators work with city agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??California's new warning system has considerable limits. ??The ISO, after all, does not determine where blackouts occur. They simply tell the three utilities in the system _ Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric _ when to shut off power and how much to turn off. ??It is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. ??PG&E's website posts which of 14 outage blocks is next to be hit, so anyone who knows their block number could use information from PG&E and the ISO websites to prepare for a blackout. ??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the Northern California utility can make tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities ""in a very short period of time."" ??""We think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given by the ISO . . . is a good thing,"" Nelson said, adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??In another development on Monday, state Controller Kathleen Connell issued another warning about the financial toll California's energy crisis is taking on the state treasury. Connell said the state could run out of cash by Sept. 1 if $ 13.4 billion in revenue bonds aren't sold. ??The state plans to sell the bonds in late August to cover the cost of buying electricity needed by financially troubled Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to serve their customers. ??Even if the bonds go through without a hitch, Connell said the state will have to seek more bonds or borrow between $3 billion and $5 billion beginning February 2002 to continue buying power. She said electricity purchases are costing the state more than the governor anticipated and far less has been bought through long-term contracts than Davis planned. ??But the governor's top energy aides challenged Connell's analysis and said they believe long-term contracts now being put in place combined with conservation efforts will bring spending down. Joe Fichera, a Davis financial adviser, said the state spent $1.8 billion to buy power in April, only 1.4 percent higher than the $1.78 billion estimated. ??""I think reasonable people can differ in terms of the projections,"" Fichera said. ""I don't know what's underlying all of her assumptions and such. We do have more complete information . . . ."" ??To highlight the exorbitant costs of power, Connell pointed to an enlarged picture of a $533 million check the state sent the Mirant Corp. for April power purchases. ??Mirant defended its sales. Included in its April sales were $126 million worth of electricity that the company bought from companies unwilling to sell to California but which Mirant purchased and then sold to California at a 12 percent markup, according to figures released by the company. ??""If the intent was to somehow attack Mirant for its role in the California market in April, then I'd have to say that the state has apparently decided to bite a helping hand,"" said Randy Harrison, CEO of Mirant's western U.S. operations. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Copley News Service News Service 22, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 1066 words HEADLINE: State sends $533.2 million to company, part of April bill BYLINE: Ed Mendel DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California, $533.2 million, went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month, April. ??Mirant, formerly Southern Energy, says more than half of the power came from three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan. ??State Treasurer Kathleen Connell, who displayed a blown-up copy of the check at a news conference yesterday, said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more than the $13.4 billion planned. ??Connell, an elected official who issues state checks, said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday, totaling $5.1 billion, provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity ''is dropping and that it will continue to drop through the summer.'' ??But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state, which has more long-term contracts than Connell has seen, is on track to control power costs with the aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing. ??''I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario,'' said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, a Davis consultant. ''It's the expected scenario.'' ??The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases, about $7 billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers. ??Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids. A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force disclosure. ??Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She declined to release details of the contracts, saying they are complicated and have varying prices. ??Connell said the check for $533,181,235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the largest she has written since taking office in 1995. ??''This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices,'' Connell said, ''even though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases power) has an executed long-term contract with this company.'' ??Mirant said in a statement that, at the request of the state, its marketing arm gave the state a ''helping hand'' by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state. ??''We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf,'' said Randy Harrison, Mirant's Western chief executive officer, ''and it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative light.'' ??Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April, while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours. ??The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour. That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive spot market during the second quarter of this year, from April through June. ??But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the state. ??Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3,000 megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost power to California. ??The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than 20,000 megawatts. The largest group of plants, 4,700 megawatts, went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing 7,000 megawatts. ??The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts, although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state. More heat means more air conditioning, and a greater strain on the system. ??But starting next month, the state's electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts. ??The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site ''power warnings'' when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a ''power watch'' when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand days. ??The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities to cut power to customers, posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site. Its Web site address is www.caiso.com. ??''There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's what we are trying to do,'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ??O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out, including whether e-mails or pagers might be used. ??In other developments in the electricity crisis: ???About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to 375,000 households as part of the ''Power Walk'' program that began during the weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million conservation program. ???Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore as communication consultants for $30,000 a month. The Republicans said Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate ''a partisan, cut-throat political communications firm.'' ???The state auditor general said in a report on energy deregulation that the state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about 20 percent of its power.

Rose DATELINE: SAN DIEGO BODY: ??San Dieg Gas and Electric's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity. ??At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday, some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers. ??''We need rates we can depend on,'' said John Roberts, who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos. ??SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation, and the utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state passed a 6.5-cent per kilowatt hour cap. ??The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of PG&E and Edison, which are about 3 cents per kilowatt hour higher. ??Yesterday's hearing, however, was for commercial rates. ??Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year, while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition, he said. ??Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive. ??''If businesses leave the state, they'll be without jobs, and a $30 savings on their power bills won't mean much,'' Roberts said. ??The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30 people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center, 330 N. Coast Highway. ??Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases.

""Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest."" ??Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. ??On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ??""California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,"" the letter said. ??Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will ""serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators."" ??""The Republicans,"" Lehane added, ""ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here."" ??Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ??""There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,"" Davis' campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. ??Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. ??After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. ??Davis emerged from the meeting saying ""the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout."" ??It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. ??* ??Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight crime, and the state's drinking water supplies. ??Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer. ??A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), and the city of Oakland. ??""A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California,"" the draft says. ""The public health, safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices."" ??Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats ??Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity since January. ??In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people ""are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed."" ??""Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men, women and children with disabilities,"" the suit says. ""They represent an imminent threat to life, health and independence."" ??Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC. ??Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit. ??""Let's face it,"" said Kelso, a Republican, ""this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months."" ??Watching the Water Supply ??The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to consumers. ??""If the water looks cloudy or dirty,"" the warning says, ""you should not drink it."" The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality, they can boil it or add ""eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes."" ??Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that ""if an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system.""

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, NANCY VOGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer, courtesy of the energy crisis: ""The 405 Freeway is jammed, there's a slim chance of showers, and oh, by the way, there's a 50% likelihood of blackouts."" ??By the end of this month, the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected. ??It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses, government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable blackout in their area. ??Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air, but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than 10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers. ??Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses, particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of electricity. ??If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's, Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making increased notification crucial. ??With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700 megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer. ??""The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them, they will check in,"" said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who serves on the Cal-ISO board. ??Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday. But a Web page called ""Today's Outlook"" on the agency's Internet site, http://www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour, how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall. ??Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergency that is expected. ??A ""power watch"" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages, and a more serious ""power warning"" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3, which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.) ??Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media, Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on ""blast lists,"" or massive computer databases that it will assemble. ??""The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we should be deploying high-tech solutions,"" said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification. ""Every time California goes black, the economy sees red."" ??Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react. ??""A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public,"" he said. ??Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most of the warnings, Florio said residents also will benefit. ??""It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners, but if someone works at home, and sets it up to get an e-mail notice, they can take advantage,"" he said. ??In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California's power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4 billion more before it runs out of cash in February. ??Calling a news conference in the capital, state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis' financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4 billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and cover future power buys for the next two years. ??Connell's opinion is notable because, as the state's chief check writer, the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret. ??Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's warnings.

Long commutes. Mediocre schools. Housing costs. At the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, the Valley's answer to Central Park, such ordinary concerns about money, time and resources stretched too thin for comfort tumbled out again and again during interviews with some two dozen people visiting this green oasis. ??Sprawling northwest from the tangled junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways, the recreation area is a pastoral patchwork of three golf courses bracketed by Woodley Avenue Park to the east and Lake Balboa to the west. It hardly looks like a battleground, but the 2,000-acre park straddles something of a political fault line in the mayoral contest. ??Both candidates in the June 5 runoff, former state legislator Antonio Villaraigosa and City Atty. James K. Hahn, have staked out the Valley as prime campaign turf, packed with thousands of up-for-grabs voters whose affections might well tip the race. ??And the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is wedged between an electoral no man's land--a southern ribbon of the Valley where about 60% of voters shunned both men in the election's first round--and a central Valley region where Villaraigosa took first place in April, beating Hahn by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. ??Between them, the candidates are expected to spend more than $10 million by election day to get their messages out. But it's not clear whether these impassioned appeals are reaching their intended targets. ??Less than a month before the election, many people here are preoccupied with concerns that have little to do with City Hall. And when they do voice interest in local matters, some seem unable to connect these issues to a candidate. ??For instance, several Valley voters interviewed in the park in early May said that knotted traffic on the San Diego Freeway was a major problem. But no one mentioned a plan Villaraigosa unveiled in March to buy hundreds of new buses and slash fares in a sweeping bid to cut vehicle traffic, or a proposal from Hahn to add more carpool lanes on freeways. ??Which raises a fundamental challenge for would-be mayors: Sometimes, there's just too much going on in everyday life to tune in to city politics. ""I know I ought to,"" many people confess sheepishly, ""but I just haven't gotten around to it yet."" ??Take Randye Sandel, 58, a blond and bespectacled oil painter from Valley Village. Sandel said she plans to vote for Hahn, ""a known quantity"" in City Hall, but a moment later admits that she might change her mind. The thing is, Sandel adds, she's been really busy setting up an art exhibition at a Santa Monica gallery and has yet to research her mayoral options. ""I've been totally immersed in my own life,"" she said. ??Same goes for Harold Seay, a muscular golfer heading back to his car after playing 18 holes. The 44-year-old music teacher from Encino said he's had his hands full for weeks rehearsing graduation recitals for a Brentwood private school. ""The news is the last thing I'm paying attention to,"" he said. ??But both voters can easily rattle off their most pressing concerns. Sandel, who used to teach art at Valley College, said she is particularly worried about education. ??""The last few semesters I taught, I was horrified by the academic preparedness of the students. They were practically illiterate,"" she said. ""They couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. That bothers me a lot. Who's going to inherit this country?"" ??Seay, who recently moved to Los Angeles from Miami, said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. Seay is African American and his wife is Italian, he said, and their 9-year-old daughter is ""stuck half-and-half,"" caught in what Seay regards as a troubling black-white divide. ""That black-white thing really turns me off,"" he said. ""I care about people getting along."" ??As the mayoral race hurtles into its final weeks, some of Hahn and Villaraigosa's most spirited skirmishes have erupted over crime and law enforcement issues. Each man is trying to burnish his own crime-fighting credentials while accusing his rival of neglecting public safety. ??The candidates have squabbled especially fiercely over compressed work schedules for police officers--the notion of squashing the police workweek into three 12-hour days, or possibly four 10-hour days. The Police Protective League endorsed Hahn, who supports the so-called 3-12 schedule favored by the union. Villaraigosa, whom Hahn has often characterized as soft on crime, seized upon the scheduling issue to retaliate, arguing that the three-day week would jeopardize public safety. ??But interviews with people visiting the Valley's biggest park revealed that crime--which has declined significantly since Mayor Richard Riordan took office eight years ago--was not the main issue weighing on these voters' minds. That distinction belongs to something that has walloped wallets far and wide across this car-addled city: the soaring price of gasoline. ??As he cooled down after a six-mile run near Balboa Lake, Ray Verdugo summed up the problem facing many gas-guzzlers as prices approached $2 a gallon: ""I made a big mistake and bought a big SUV,"" lamented the retired Rocketdyne engineer from Winnetka. ""I'm on a fixed income, and [gasoline prices] keep going up all the time."" ??Big-city mayors, to be sure, wield minimal influence over gasoline pumps. Gas prices are swayed by market forces, including the international cost of crude oil, rising demand and limited refinery capacity. Nonetheless, about a third of voters interviewed as they ambled around the Sepulveda Basin named gas prices as a top concern. Half as many said they were worried about crime. ??Some voters said they were troubled by California's electricity woes, although Los Angeles residents have been spared shortages and blackouts because the city's municipal utility avoided deregulation. ??""I think building more power plants would help,"" said Julie Erickson, 27, a figure-skating instructor from Reseda. ??And then there are the things that people aren't talking about. Nobody (at least nobody in an admittedly unscientific sample of voters culled over two days in the Sepulveda Basin) mentioned the Rampart police scandal or the recruiting problems crippling the Los Angeles Police Department. ??No one uttered so much as a peep about neighborhood councils, that much-ballyhooed innovation of the new city charter. Even the Valley secession movement--which Villaraigosa has pointed to as ""the biggest challenge facing Los Angeles""--hardly earned an honorable mention from this cross-section of Valleyites. Only one voter referred to secession at all, saying that she favored it. ??Instead, many people voiced personal gripes, the kind of woes unlikely to vault to the center of the mayoral radar screen--but issues that nonetheless embody the high quality of life both candidates envision for Los Angeles. ??One man, a sunburned golfer who lives in Van Nuys, said he's dismayed that the city hasn't finished building a new golf clubhouse and restaurant at the Woodley Lakes Golf Course. Another frequent park visitor, a retired housekeeper from Sherman Oaks, complained about the windblown litter she sees as she walks her dog around Balboa Lake. ??But some problems vexing these voters seem frankly beyond the grasp of even the most poll-tested candidate. ??Sandel, the oil painter, got downright metaphysical after a good 15 minutes spent mulling the troubles facing Los Angeles, and indeed the world. Technology, she concluded, was advancing so rapidly that it was crowding out humanity's intuitive, spiritual side. ??""I think there's an extraordinary sense of collective despair and psychological uncertainty smoldering just below the surface,"" she said. ""I don't know what City Hall can do about that."" GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Ray Verdugo, a retired Rocketdyne engineer, says, ""I'm on a fixed income, and [gas prices] keep going up all the time.""

The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utility companies to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utility companies also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utility companies and is difficult for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators, and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment fret that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 the ISO will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. It will issue a 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts begin but will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana (Orange County), who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices, called the ""ramping"" allegations, first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday, ""outrageous acts of manipulation."" ???Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law, legislation could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future. ???""We're looking at it, yes, from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced to render it a violation for future such acts."" ???Dunn's committee already has been investigating charges that power generators ""gamed"" the wholesale energy market to boost their profits. ???The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants, sometimes several times within an hour. ???Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity. The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts, which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour. The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants, leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants. ???The senate committee, which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California, has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power-generating companies. Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine which plants employed the ramping tactic. He added that the issue would be examined in a public hearing in the coming weeks. ???Meanwhile, pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year. ???Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission, which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns, has narrowed its focus. It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offline during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies. ???Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal. However, Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diego-area plant co-owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston and NRG Inc. of Minneapolis. Another was a Pittsburg plant owned by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. The companies denied the allegations. ???On another front, Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County), were expected to file a lawsuit this morning against the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee for failing to carry out its stated duty of ensuring ""just and reasonable"" electricity rates. ???""Their central failing is that they don't follow the law,"" Burton said in an interview.

""When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes' warning. Two minutes may be fine in a football game, but it's not fine for California's economy or safety."" ???ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ???The plan, detailed in a report issued yesterday, still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a ""buyer's cartel"" that would refuse to pay for power when prices become too high. ???""It's not the report I was expecting, but 30 minutes of notice is certainly better than two,"" said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray. ""No matter how you slice it, this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery."" ???A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21.8 billion, said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses. ???""In this electrically unreliable world, any notification manufacturers can get is good,"" said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the association. ""While 30 minutes won't be enough for some, for most manufacturers it will be sufficient."" The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmakers regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts, said Michael Florio, an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network. ???""There are bigger public policy ramifications,"" Florio said. ???The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the changes are just updates of policies already in place. ???WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS ???The 30-minute advance-notification system, scheduled to go into effect early next month, would warn of ""probable"" blackouts, including the amount of load that will have to be curtailed in each service area. ???Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ???The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. ???This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations, said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ???Also planned by the ISO is a ""Power Watch/Power Warning"" system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days. ???Under the two-tiered system, a ""Power Watch"" would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely, while a ""Power Warning"" would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage Three alert. ???With one report suggesting California may see as many as 700 hours of rolling blackouts this summer, lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to make the outages easier for power customers to cope with. ???The idea of a buyer's cartel, the subject of a Capitol hearing today, would have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one dime more. ???The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity. ???The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand. ???The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in, supporters said. ???DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS ???Meanwhile, Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, will introduce a bill today that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block. ???For example, a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 if blackouts are needed that day. ???""Right now, every day is a potential blackout day,"" Briggs said. ""This way people would know when their potential days are."" ??On alert ???-- When demand is high, the ISO will forecast peak demand, power supply and weather 24 hours in advance. ???-- A ""power watch"" will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Stage 1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is within 5% of running out of power). ???-- A ""power warning"" will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of a Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply). ???Who calls a blackout? ???Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity, the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes' notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut. ???Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long? ???A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers into 14 blocks; each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography. Thus, neighborhoods in San Francisco, Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously. ???Q: How many users are blacked out at once? ???A: Each of PG&E's 14 ???blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1,000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550 megawatts, it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can black out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for less than 550 megawatts. ???Q: How is power shut off? ???A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand. ???Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected? ???A: A total of 3,035,000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan. 1, 2001. ???Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next? ???A: Some or all customers in Block 1. ???Q: How do I know what block I'm in? ???A: Look for the words ""Rotating Outage Block"" followed by a number on your bill. If it says Block 50, you share an electrical circuit with a hospital, police station or other ""essential service"" that is normally exempt from service cuts. ???Q: What should I do when the lights go out? ???A: Power experts advise: ???-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surges when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electricity is back. ???-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all intersections as a four-way stop. ???-- To protect food, open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary. ???-- Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles, observe the usual safety precautions. ???-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if only your home is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. ???-- When the power returns, turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges. ???-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. ???-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, to turn off the TV and computers, and not to use candles. ???Sources: PG&E, Chronicle staff ???Chronicle Graphic ??E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

""And he's got to stop looking so cozy with business."" ??The president's proposal emphasizes stepped-up production and modest conservation measures. It received mixed reviews from an anxious public that appears to want quick relief but sees the plan only helping after several years. ??Although Bush says his program will allow Americans to retain the lifestyle they are accustomed to, only 30% of those surveyed said they believe it. Two of three said major lifestyle changes will be necessary to solve the nation's energy woes. ??Nearly half said the Bush plan would not do enough to conserve energy, and 43% said the plan would do too little to increase production. ??Americans also were split over the Bush proposal to increase the number of nuclear power plants to generate electricity: 49% for and 46% against. ??The tepid response to the Bush energy plan might have been a factor in raising his job-disapproval rating from 31% a week ago to 36% now, the highest of his presidency. His 56% job-approval rating did not change from a week ago. ??Bush's strongest disapproval came from Democrats, low-income earners, women under 50 and residents of California, a state wrestling with electricity shortages. ??California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was highly critical of the Bush plan. He said it ""does nothing to address the astronomical run-up in the prices of electricity, natural gas and gasoline (and) favors more energy production at the expense of everything else."" ??White House spokesman Claire Buchan said the president will continue to press his plan, regardless of the polls: ""The president does not govern by polls. This is a serious issue that has been neglected for years, and he has begun a serious dialogue with the American people. It will continue."" ??Most poll respondents said they see threats of electricity shortages and the rising price of gasoline and heating fuels as serious problems, although only 12% said they see a ""state of crisis."" And most of those polled said Bush is not doing enough to address those problems. ??At the same time, most said energy companies have too much influence over the administration's energy polices, an argument Democrats raise. ??One in five said the Bush administration deserves a great deal of blame for the energy problems; 28% put a great deal of that blame on the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather, the traffic and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday that it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30, it will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warnings to the media and others before any blackouts begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. ""Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do."" ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends.

The plant, owned by local power wholesaler Pinnacle West Energy, will produce enough electricity to serve about 120,000 homes, though much of it may be sold elsewhere. ??On Monday, PG&E National Energy Group, a sister of California's financially squeezed PG&E Gas and Electric, broke ground for its planned $500 million generating plant west of Phoenix that will use natural gas. ??It's one of up to 11 plants planned for Arizona by out-of-state interests. Three such plants are expected to begin production this summer, though much of their power also may be sold to other states. ??That's true of the PG&E National plant, too, but those who live in the vicinity don't care. ??""We have nothing out here now,"" said Elisa Bigbey of Harquahala Valley. ""We want to get something going."" ??The plant will increase the assessed valuation of the area by 17 times and will generate $10.7 million in new property taxes. PG&E already has given the local school district a portable shed in which to store records because the district's only school was damaged by a November fire. ??PG&E also is making a no-strings outright gift to the community of $550,000 in 11 annual cash installments. A committee of local residents will decide how to spend the windfall. ??Meanwhile, Panda Energy of Dallas and Teco Power Services of Tampa, Fla., recently broke ground for a plant south of the PG&E site, and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C., and Sempra Energy of San Diego each have started plants in the Arlington Valley. ??Pinnacle West Generating has a plant under construction near the Palo Verde nuclear plant in this same general area. ??Additionally, the Desert Basin Plant in Casa Grande is owned by Reliant Energy of Houston. The Griffith Energy Plant near Kingman is owned by Duke Energy and P&L Global. The Southpoint plant, set to begin production next month near Bullhead City, is owned by Calpine Corp. of San Jose. ??Such plants have come to Arizona because there's lot of space in Arizona, water is relatively inexpensive, there's access to natural gas, regulators are friendly and the plants can be situated at a distance from urban air pollution controls. ??The PG&E plant will produce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides that can lead to formation of ozone, an air pollution problem against Phoenix has been fighting for years. ??Additionally, the plant will use 6,500 acre feet of water a year, enough to meet the needs of a town of about 30,000. PG&E expects to use surplus Central Arizona Project water from the distant Colorado River - but the Harquahala Valley has a good supply of underground water PG&E can tap if the CAP surplus disappears.

The Independent System Operator will also be issuing a daily energy forecast with projected supply and demand, and the likelihood of blackouts. Several lawmakers say they'll introduce plans that would give Californians even more notice of blackouts - from one day to one month. ??- The state auditor releases a report on the state's energy crisis, saying previous estimates that the state could avoid blackouts this summer are overly optimistic. The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission, saying the commission hasn't responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line project. ??- Gov. Gray Davis is in Chicago, speaking with city officials there about blackout procedures. ??- Davis' energy advisers say that the state is meeting its energy goals, despite doubts raised by Controller Kathleen Connell and other critics. Connell questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheap enough to avoid borrowing more than the $13.4 billion approved by state lawmakers. But Davis adviser Joe Fichera says the state has signed more long-term power contracts that will help keep prices low. ??- Davis' office announces that an eighth ""peaker"" power plant has been licensed. The 135-megawatt plant in Gilroy is expected to be online by the end of September. The California Energy Commission says that more than 10,000 megawatts of new electricity since April 1999. ??- The California Energy Commission also announces increased rebates for renewable energy systems - such as solar panels, fuel cells or small wind generation. Rebates of up to 50 percent on the system are available for residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural users. ??- Republican legislative leaders criticize Davis for spending tax money on a political communications firm that previously advised Vice President Al Gore. Davis is hiring Gore's former press secretary and deputy campaign manager for six months at $30,000 a month to coordinate the governor's communications on energy issues. Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte and Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox say Davis should pay them with campaign funds, not taxpayers' money. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $11.23, down 51 cents. PG&E Corp. dropped 48 cents to close at $11.16. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. ??- Davis is scheduled to sign a bill Tuesday that would expedite power plant siting. ??- Republican Assemblyman Mike Briggs plans to introduce a bill that would allow people to know a month ahead if they will be affected by rolling blackouts. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 36 percent for residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

It is at once a triumph of technology and Western gumption, and a reminder of how tenuous it all is. ??The great growth in the West followed a simple recipe: Water plus power equals population. There was always a feeling that the land was so big you couldn't use it up, not the resources, not the space. ??Today there are signs that's no longer true. In California, blackouts. In Oregon and Washington, drought. In Arizona, arsons to stop construction. And in every rearview mirror, more traffic all the time. ??The allure of vast prairies, open skies and endless opportunity is what first drew people out West. But as deserts disappear under development, possibilities become problems. ??Now, with its infrastructure strained by growth, the West faces difficult choices: Energy or environment? Freeways or orchards? Water for people or fish? ??""We're losing what we've come for, this ideal,"" says James Corless, California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, which aims to diversify transportation systems to reduce traffic and pollution caused by growth. ""And we are loath to change."" ??--- ??When the streets went dark in California, a light bulb came on across the West. ??The region saw its vulnerability. For one very important resource, demand had won out over supply. What about all the others? ??""We've got an infrastructure that can't really carry much additional power. We're starting to see the same situation with water,"" says John Maddox, president of the Denver-based Center for the New West. ??And people keep coming. ??The West added more than 10 million people in the 1990s, making it the fastest-growing region in the United States. In the next decade, another 10 million are expected. ??""What does that mean?"" Maddox says. ""How many new roads, new water infrastructure and treatment facilities, how many new runways and airports?"" ??Perhaps more than clogged freeways and periodic droughts, the power crisis has brought home the reality that there are limits to growth. ??In California, electricity consumption rose 24 percent in the past five years as the economy grew by 29 percent. However, no major new plants were built in the state in the past 10 years, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ??Several projects to generate new power were shelved in the 1990s, because of regulatory red-tape, environmental protests, economics and wariness over the state's deregulation plan. ??As a result, the power ran low and California was forced to go to the open market in search of electricity, sending power rates soaring and shutting out the lights in rolling blackouts. ??California officials now predict it will take two to three years before energy production catches up with demand. ??Meanwhile, the crisis has crossed state lines. In the Northwest, generating capacity grew 4 percent in the 1990s, while demand grew 24 percent. That wasn't a problem when abundant rain and snow produced above-average hydropower generation between 1995 and 2000. ??Then drought hit, and generation dropped. Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana are about 3,000 megawatts short of the electricity they need. ??Now everyone's playing catch-up. California is on a plant-building spree, while other states are pushing conservation and looking for alternative fuel sources. ??Even in power-hungry Las Vegas, the mega-resorts are cutting back. The MGM Grand refitted its 5,000 guest rooms with low-watt fluorescent bulbs and changed its casino-floor lighting. Treasure Island's parking garage is switching to sodium bulbs that use 30 percent less energy. ??But a feeling of dread is gripping some Westerners. If the lights can go out, what's next? Dry faucets? ??""The thing I worry about is water,"" says Carol Ann Heggie-Hall, a retired science teacher who moved from Queens, N.Y., to Henderson, Nev., in 1999. ""Is there enough water for everyone and their plants?"" ??Much of the West is facing the worst drought in a quarter-century, prompting warnings of environmental degradation, forest fires and agricultural decline. Nevertheless, experts say the West isn't in danger of running out of water. The challenge is determining who gets how much. ??""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if the faucets ran dry in Scottsdale, there are places to go to get water,"" says Joe Hunter, a power and water specialist at the Center for the New West. ""But it means shifting it from one use to another."" ??About 80 percent of water in most Western states is used to irrigate crops, a percentage that could drop if residential supplies were strained, Hunter says. ??Western states and cities must also do more to share water. ??California has long used more than its allocation from the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to seven Western states. An agreement allows California to receive surplus water if it implements conservation measures that will reduce its reliance on the river in the future. ??In the meantime, Western cities are looking elsewhere to sustain the supply. The Las Vegas Valley predicts it will reach its annual Colorado River allocation by 2007, so its regional water authority is negotiating to store 1.2 million acre feet of water in Arizona for the next 15 years. ??Beyond power and water, other infrastructure problems persist. In the Vegas area, which added 700,000 people in the '90s, road closures due to highway expansions are a daily occurrence. ??""There are few roads you can drive on that aren't under construction,"" admits Jim Gibson, mayor of Henderson, a city south of Vegas that is among the country's most rapidly growing communities. ??Without the new roads, Vegas transportation officials estimate there would be 2,289 miles of congestion by the year 2025, compared with 341 miles last year. ??Highways alleviate congestion, but also drive more growth. ??Interstate 5, the north-south freeway through Washington and Oregon, became a growth magnet. In Colorado, Interstate 70 has opened the mountains to staggering growth west of Denver. ??-- ??In the fastest-growing metro area in the fastest-growing state in the fastest-growing region of the country, Greg Cox and Dale Stark are unloading dirt on a Las Vegas street crammed with construction workers. ??The landscapers are a rare breed in a town teeming with newcomers: Cox has lived here all his life; Stark moved from Southern California in 1979. ??Both grumble about the changes they've seen, and both vow to leave. ??""I moved here when this town was nice,"" Stark says. ""Now you can't drive down the road without getting cut off and flipped off."" ??Cox complains he can barely get around at all. A drive across town used to take 20 minutes.

BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather, the traffic - and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators, and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30, it will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. ""Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do."" ??Assemblyman Fred Keeley, the Legislature's point man on energy, acknowledged that scheduling blackouts could attract criminals and open the state to legal liability for accidents at blacked-out intersections. ??""That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,"" Keeley said earlier. ""I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately."" ??The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends. ??State Assemblyman Mike Briggs said he plans to introduce a bill that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??""We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,"" Briggs said.

Gray Davis and the economy has plunged in the face of a statewide energy crisis, according to a poll released Monday. ??""This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders,"" said Mark Baldassare, director of the survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??The institute, a nonprofit organization that researches economic, social and political issues, interviewed 2,001 adult California residents, in English and Spanish, between May 1 and May 9.

Forty-four percent believe it is on the right track. ??The poll also found that Californians blame the electric utility companies more than anyone else for the energy crunch. Thirty-two percent said they fault utilities, while 26 percent blame former Gov.

And if generators don't lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he said. ??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the state's current method of ""highly disruptive random rolling blackouts"" needs to be revamped. ??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration. ??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. ??""That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,"" Keeley said. ""I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately."" ??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies short. ??Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??""We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,"" Briggs said. ""If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly."" ??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops. ??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. ??Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. ??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said. California power consumers would in essence form ""a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging,"" she said. ??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash-strapped privately owned utilities. ??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point last week. ??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 years. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com/ LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 901 words HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities. ??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills, and near the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills, is a number called baseline, which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge. ??This number, which differs from customer to customer based on a host of factors, is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history start showing up on bills. ??""Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher, it's going to require that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do when long distance telephone service was deregulated,"" said Commissioner Carl Wood of the Public Utilities Commission. ??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC, everyone who exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 percent average hike on their overall bill, translating to an increase of roughly $85 a month. ??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30 percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around half of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category. ??But consumer rights groups, and even the utilities, think the PUC is underestimating residential electric use, given the recent proliferation of home computers, cell phone chargers and the like. ??They think baseline is set too low for many customers, and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes. ??""It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying within baseline,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. ""A rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large households."" ??Since 1982, when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation, the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions. ??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and central California; Edison has six in central and southern California. ??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount, and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction, breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey, given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??Since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely, economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??""Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, Florio said. ""Does PG&E come by and do bed checks?"" ??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since January, the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. ??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president Loretta Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??""There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,"" Wood said. ??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years, ""living standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was,"" Wood said. ??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers. There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??Add that to increased conservation statewide, Florio said, and there's a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes. ??""It's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy more efficiently,"" through the years, Florio said. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??Pacific Gas and Electric Co.: http://www.pge.com ??Southern California Edison Co.: http://www.sce.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 273 words HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed in the wrong direction. ??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, according to a new poll. ??The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll was conducted in English and Spanish. ??The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis. ??""Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other growth-related problems,"" said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's survey director. ""This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders."" ??Change has come swiftly. ??In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the right direction, compared to 48 percent this month. ??Other key findings include: ??-82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years will make California a less desirable place to live. ??-86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's economy. ??-43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32 percent in January.

Headlines proclaimed a ""crisis,"" and legislative leaders shifted into an ""I told you so"" mode. ??Hold the phone. ??This is not California. There is no crisis. Customers with interruptible service contracts have always been subject to cutoffs in times of peak consumption or when generators are down. ??It may not be fair to suggest that Alliant Energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law, but the timing is nonetheless convenient. The Legislature is set to convene a special session in a few weeks, and among the business left over from the regular session could be a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating plants. ??While crisis is not imminent, Iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... ??While Iowa's law may need some ""streamlining,"" which could be dealt with in a special session, that should not be the end of the matter. Ultimately, the Legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes a regional view of energy, that reflects new market and regulation realities, and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. ??Legislative session: ??TELEGRAPH HERALD ??Even after a marathon legislative session - this one lasted 121 days - why does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??This year's session started out strong, passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. It finished up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. ??But just what happened in those middle 100 or so days is a little murky. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall, the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... ??-Legislators didn't get around to a ... bill to close a loophole in Iowa's Open Records law. The way it stands now, a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-The Legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate, so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... The issue of fairness needs to be addressed. ??Floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax, while racetracks pay a gradually increasing tax that now stands at 30 percent. Under the law enacted in 1997, that tax will grow to 36 percent by 2004. ??-Other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to include: cutting state income tax on Social Security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. ??So the 2002 Legislature will have its work cut out for it. Here are some jobs for next year's to-do list: ??-Amend the Open Records Law. Allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. ??-Carry the ball on increasing teachers' pay. The $40 million shot in the arm will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-Freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. The disparity between racetracks and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??And if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate, lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before May. ??IOWA CITY PRESS-CITIZEN: ??We agree with Gov. Tom Vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators ""will cause hardship for people and families across our state."" ??That's what happens when you face a $300 million revenue shortfall, and you don't have as much money as you wanted. ??But we disagree that ""for 3 1/2 months, they did very little."" ??On the contrary, Vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark of this session - $40 million for teacher pay raises and a new system for teacher pay. ??And the Republican-led Legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities, long a goal of Vilsack's Democratic Party. ??Are we happy with the budget? No. ??Is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? Yes. ??Vilsack should sign budget legislation, rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the Legislature this summer. ... ??Plant Sciences Institute: ??DES MOINES REGISTER: ??Iowa needs more people, especially young people. Iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses, small and large, to spring up here. So why did Iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??They blame it on a tight budget. Blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. The fledgling Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 Legislature provided no new money. ??It did continue the $4.67 million approved in 2000. It did not add $3 million, a meager increase proposed by the governor. It allowed ISU to keep money from the sale of land, with proceeds to be used for the institute's Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory, to be completed by 2002. It should have added at least $10 million in cash. ... ??Because of legislative inaction, promising initiatives must slow down, or may never take place. ... ??The institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??Ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... Such a facility might extract protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals, food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. The Plant Sciences Institute has a small, pilot protein-extraction facility. New money from the Legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. But now? ""The people interested in this will probably go elsewhere,"" said Director Stephen Howell. ??Why wouldn't they? Plenty of other states are serious about fostering biotech industries. The Iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??Iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. Investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to make Iowa's economy and population grow. Stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??Ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. The question should be what sort of future will Iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the Plant Sciences Institute holds. ??Hunting requirements: ??AMES TRIBUNE: ??In April, the Iowa House and Senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the Department of Natural Resources, saying it was ""just another hassle,"" for hunters. ??Then, the House hiked the fees for hunting licenses, in some cases up to 218 percent. A non-resident who wants to hunt deer in Iowa under this plan will have to shell out $308, including a hunting license and habitat fee. The current total is $156. ??Hassle? You got it. We might as well hang a sign on Iowa borders that says we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here, either. Add to the mix a federal whammy in the Freedom to Farm Act, which has all but eliminated any fence rows, and hunting as a potential tourism draw to Iowa blows away in the wind. ... ??Instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations, Department of Natural Resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??Surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration, and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??The DNR asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries, travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. And we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. ??We also would allow that some of the increases do not seem to us to be egregious. A $3 fish habitat fee for instance, isn't a great deal to pay. Nor is a $30 tab for a non-resident 7-day fishing license out of line. ??But some fee hikes were too much. ??In particular, the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states, and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. Wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. Missouri charges $125. License fees in Iowa are likely to result in less money coming in, not more. What out-of-state hunter will be drawn to Iowa when surrounding states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??Iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. We wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. We say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. Yet these votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??Public official recruits: ??QUAD-CITY TIMES: ??More Iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents, but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??In effect, it allows private firms to dictate public policy, and that's troubling. ??One example of this trend is the Camanche School District, where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently. They met with school board members, district staff and some residents, yet the board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. The Cedar Rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??Headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. Under Iowa law, a public entity such as a school board must honor such a request. ??Some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??Those arguments aren't justified, for reasons including: ??-There is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. Indeed, being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-Identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information, critical or supportive, that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-And being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??We prefer a process similar to one used by the City of Clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. The five finalists were not only identified, they took part in an open house to meet the public. A headhunter firm was used, but City Attorney Bruce Johansen, himself a candidate who did not get the job, said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names should be made public. ??We applaud that effort ... ??Meanwhile, the Iowa Legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. The change would require that official communication between private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. Whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??We encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect July 1. ??Train service: ??CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: ??Who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal Department of Human Services last winter might affect whether Davenport, Iowa City and Des Moines get rail service. ??But consider that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, who resigned recently from the Amtrak board, had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the Midwest while he was governor of Wisconsin. Thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the Amtrak board after he went to Washington. But the Associated Press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the Amtrak board says only one of the seven seats can be held by a member of the Cabinet - and the Bush administration wants Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta on the governing board. ??Few people around are as passionate as Thompson about Amtrak, and Iowa could have benefited. It's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of Iowans live. Maybe the service will be expanded here. But maybe, with the changes in the governing board, that train has already left the station. ??Smoker identification: ??LE MARS DAILY SENTINAL: ??Have you heard the news from Walgreen's? They're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes, a box of cigars, a can of chew. ??Everybody. Not under 18. Not 27 and under.

The stock is on a steep decline this year, trading in the 52 week range of 6 to 32, last at about 11 1/2.

ROBERT GLYNN, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PG&E: Good morning, Mark. HAINES: So where do we stand now? GLYNN: Well, we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding, where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves and our creditors. We have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who, after all, need to get paid. HAINES: So let's first talk about time. How much time do you think this might take before PG&E emerges from bankruptcy? GLYNN: Well, it's very hard to tell for one reason. There have not been very many utility bankruptcies and I don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. The shortest possible time or shortest likely time that I've heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. The longest that I've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than I want it to take. HAINES: In the meantime you are selling electricity, transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. Are you still losing money on your operating? GLYNN: Well, the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the California independent system operator is still buying on behalf of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. And that's an issue that's before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for decision making right now. HAINES: Well, I guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? GLYNN: Well, the electric rates in California have just been raised by the California Public Utilities Commission in order to have the state, the Department of Water Resources be able to recover all of its costs because that's what, of course, it wants to do. It doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. So this most recent large rate increase has applied, as best as we can tell, exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover some of the ones that we're responsible for. JOE BATTIPAGLIA: Mr. Glynn, the brownouts continue in California. What's the status of supply of electricity into the state, putting aside for a moment how you pay for it? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak. Every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 and probably 2002 as well, simply because there's not enough power to go around. BATTIPAGLIA: Does that spread from California to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity market and the Pacific Northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many, many years shipping power back and forth to one another. That has been interrupted because of the supply shortage in California, which means that California is trying to be a net importer all the time. And it seems like the Pacific Northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to California that it's had in the past. HAINES: Does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? GLYNN: I don't think it ends there at all, Mark. And I certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use its capital on, like education and infrastructure. And I do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. It's got to be resolved by building new supply. There's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple of years before that new construction is fully completed. HAINES: All right, sir. Thank you very much for the update. We appreciate it. Robber Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO.

BODY: ??THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. ??ANNOUNCER: Live from Washington, this is INSIDE POLITICS, with Judy Woodruff. ??Amid growing bloodshed in the Middle East, the United States endorses recommendations aimed at ending the violence. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??COLIN POWELL, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud and clear way. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ANNOUNCER: Also ahead: Is President Bush taking a hit in the polls in connection with the energy crunch? ??And to what degree has a certain Yale graduate finally embraced his alma mater? ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everything I know about the spoken word I learned right here at Yale. ??(LAUGHTER) ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ANNOUNCER: Now Judy Woodruff takes you INSIDE POLITICS. ??JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you for joining us. ?We begin with the Bush administration responding to pressure to get more involved in promoting Middle East peace. ??As an escalating cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians continued today, Secretary of State Colin Powell appointed a diplomat to help the two sides end the fighting and resume talks. ?And he urged the parties to use the report of a commission appointed by former President Clinton as a springboard to peace. ??Let's get more now from CNN national security correspondent David Ensor -- David. DAVID ENSOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Judy, Ambassador William Burns, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, who is Mr. Powell's pick to be the next assistant secretary for the Middle East, has been asked to work with other recommendations for Mr. Powell and for President Bush on how the U.S. can best proceed from here, trying to use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report to try to get the violence to de- escalate, to try to get the two sides talking instead of shooting at each other. ??Here is how Mr. Powell put it today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??POWELL: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud-and- clear way, and take actions that are available to them on both sides to let's have a cessation of hostilities, then we can begin the confidence-building measures and move toward negotiations. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ENSOR: Now this report makes very specific recommendations and urges very specific actions by both sides: in both cases, quite difficult actions. ?First, it calls for the Palestinians and the Israelis to declare an immediate, unconditional cessation of violence. That's the first step, and that's the step that Secretary Powell repeatedly emphasized today must come first and must come right away or else nothing else will work. ??But the report goes on to make specific recommendations. ?For example, it urges that Israel put -- freeze all settlement development, all development of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. ?It recommends that Israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the Palestinian Authority. ?It recommends a whole range of action, many of them to be taken by Israel, which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it needs to be, would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. ??The -- the secretary, Secretary Powell, said that this is not the time, however, for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?He wants first to have Ambassador Burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next week, two weeks or three, and then he and the president will try to figure out where the U.S. can go from here. ??But clearly, this is -- clearly, this is a first step by an administration that until now has tried to keep its -- keep its powder a bit dry in the Middle East. ?They are now engaging somewhat, because they're so concerned about the situation out there, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: David, the report, the Mitchell report, suggesting that the Israelis more responsible here, or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the Palestinians? ENSOR: The report is very even-handed. ?It doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?It, for example, does not blame Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for the following Intifada, Intifada II it's been called. ?But it says that there needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions, and if you look at the list of what it's asking for, there are more steps that the Israelis would have to take than the Palestinians. ??WOODRUFF: And David, why is it that the administration is saying at this point that it is not prepared to get back in -- in a -- in a day-to-day way, in an energetically involved way the way the Clinton administration was? ??ENSOR: Well, I think the administration, this administration, feels that the Clinton people got -- got to the point where they were micromanaging the thing a little bit. ?It was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?They feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??However, the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly, and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?And that's why Ambassador Burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: All right. ?David Ensor reporting for us from the State Department. ??For more on the Middle East conflict, stay with us for a special half-hour report. ?That's beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. ??Now, we turn to questions about the Bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?Tonight, Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to host some 400 big GOP donors at his official residence in Washington. ?A spokeswoman for the Democrats says that that event smacks of, in her words, hypocrisy. ??The Democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable to Clinton-era events, such as White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers for big donors, which drew heavy criticism from Republicans. ?Among them: presidential candidate George W. Bush. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??BUSH: I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here,"" from the Oval Office desk to the buck stops here on the Lincoln Bedroom. ?And that's not good for the country, it's not right. ?We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There's a huge trust. ?I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, ""I don't want you to let me down again."" ??And we can do better than the past administration has done. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Despite that sort of criticism then, the Republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at Vice President Cheney's home tonight. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MAJORITY LEADER: I'm sure it's being done in an inappropriate way, or Dick Cheney wouldn't -- wouldn't be doing it. ?So if there's any question, I'd suggest you address it to them. ?Unfortunately, I think that most of us will not be able to be there. ?We're going to be here voting, giving tax relief. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Virtually all of those GOP contributors, who will mingle with Vice President Cheney at his home tonight, have given at least $100,000 to the Republican National Committee. ?They will also attend a major RNC fund-raiser tomorrow night that features President Bush as the main speaker and is expected to net some $15 million in soft money. ??Now let's bring in our White House correspondent, Major Garrett. ??Major, tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??MAJOR GARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's the first official Republican National Committee event to honor the president and the first lady, as you said. The targeted haul is $15 million. Republican National Committee officials tell CNN that it's about 70 percent of that 15 million will be soft money. ?About 30 percent will be hard dollars -- that is dollars that are regulated under the existing campaign finance scheme -- and that it is a big event, one that the Republican Party has held for years and years in Washington. ??As for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told me this is a way of saying ""Thank you,"" in his words, ""to those Republicans who,"" as Ari Fleischer said, ""did so much to help win the selection."" ??And he draws a distinction with the Clinton-era coffees and sleepovers, describing them as, quote, ""organized schemes to bring people through the gates of the White House to get money or to persuade others to do so."" ??Mark Minor, who is the communications director for the Republican National Committee, also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. No checks will pass between hands there. There is no quid pro quo, and that some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact RNC donors -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: So, Major, again, clarify the distinction between money events that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??GARRETT: Well, it's a distinction this White House wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?In the words of Ari Fleischer, thanking someone, whether it's on government property or not on government property, is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?The distinction he is drawing is that during the Clinton era people were brought to the White House, to these coffees, and as was disclosed in the Thompson report that was conducted by the Senate investigating that, there was some evidence of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in, money was described to bringing in for a coffee. ?A certain dollar amount was attached to donations to the Democratic National Committee, a larger amount if they, in fact, slept here at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom. ?That is the key distinction, the Republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to come to the vice president's residence. ??They also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to Washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney in the vice president's home. ??WOODRUFF: And Major, just to clarify, the 400 people invited tonight to the vice president's, how many are they saying did not give money? ??GARRETT: They're not disclosing any numbers. ?They're only saying that some have given. ?They clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?Some are lobbyists. Some represent large corporations. ?But others, they say, are just Republican National Committee officials. And others of an undisclosed nature -- not fund-raisers, not Republican Party officials -- who will be there tonight. Don't have any numbers for you on that, though. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Major Garrett reporting at the White House. Thank you very much. ??Vice President Cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics, not to mention his role in creating the Bush energy plan. Look that this: ??Our new poll shows Cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?While Mr. Bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the past couple of weeks, he has lost ground since late April. ?Cheney's approval rating has dipped as well. ??For more on Mr. Bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies, we are joined now by our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ??Tell us, Bill, which of Mr. Bush's policies is the most popular? ??WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you might guess energy, given the high ratings for Dick Cheney that you just reported -- but you would be wrong. ??Because, what Americans like best is the tax cut. ?Two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?That's up from 60 percent earlier this month. Well, why not? ?What's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??Actually, most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?They like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?And that is why so many Democrats find it very difficult to oppose. ??WOODRUFF: What about the energy plan? ??SCHNEIDER: Not such a success. ?Not like the tax cut. ?Americans are actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?Why? ?It's not because the public blames the Bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?Most people blame the oil companies. ??In fact, more people blame Congress and the Clinton administration and environmental laws and American consumers than blame the Bush administration. But most Americans still give President Bush low marks on energy. ?The core criticism of his energy plan is: it doesn't do enough. ?55 percent of Americans say President Bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. ??What doesn't the plan do? ?It doesn't do much right now. ?Only 8 percent of Americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. Most people think oh, it will help, but only after several years. ?It's a long-run solution. ?Americans want help now. ?Right now. ?With electricity in California. ?And with gas prices all over the country. ?Long-term solutions are important, but politics is a short-term business. ?If the problem is now, people want results now. ??And they don't see what the Bush energy plan is going to do about $2-a-gallon gasoline now. ??WOODRUFF: Why do people think the energy plan fails to do that? ??SCHNEIDER: Because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?Oilmen like $2-a-gallon gasoline. ?Maybe even 3. ??By nearly two to one, the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the Bush administration's policies. ?In fact, Americans are split when you ask them whether the Bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?That sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?But any administration that's run by Texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Bill Schneider, thank you very much. You're not suspect. ??SCHNEIDER: I am certainly not. ??WOODRUFF: At least as far as we know. ??Do Californians blame President Bush for their energy crisis? We've heard a little bit from Bill on that. ?That answer and more on the issue later this hour. ?Plus: ??Just what kind of tax cut is the Senate considering? ?Jonathan Karl crunches the numbers. ?Also: ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?You don't set the agenda every day, and that is real power in the House. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The trials and tribulations of the minority leader, as he considers the present and the future. ?And later: ??Rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?A political ""Profile In Courage."" All ahead on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: President Bush today donned the traditional commencement robes, and gave the graduating class at Yale University a few bits of advice. ?The president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?As CNN's Kelly Wallace reports, today's speech was a departure from how the President's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??KELLY WALLACE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A homecoming of sorts, George W. Bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since graduating in 1968, returns to address those at the top and the bottom of Yale's graduating class. ??BUSH: And to the C students... ??(LAUGHTER) ??I say, you too, can be president of the United States. ??(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ??WALLACE: The president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as the undergraduate, when, as a history major, he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??The visit was not without controversy, with some students protesting and some professors boycotting, charging that Mr. Bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??PETER BROOKS, YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: It doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we think that Yale stands for. ??WALLACE: The president has kept his distance from this Ivy League institution for most of his political life, painting it as a symbol of elitism, even during his days at Yale. TERRY JOHNSON, BUSH'S YALE ROOMMATE: What George -- does not respond well to are people who are snobs, whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush rarely mentions what he did on this day, that he was born in New Haven when his dad, the former president, was an undergraduate at Yale. ??BUSH: My life began just a few blocks from here, but I was raised in West Texas. ?From there, Yale always seemed a world away. ??WALLACE: The president, for years, had been miffed with Yale for not awarding an honorary degree to his dad until 1991, the third year of his presidency. ?But it appears now, all is forgiven. ??BUSH: In my time they spoke of the Yale man, I was really never sure of what that was. ?But I do think that I am a better man because of Yale. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush, the son and grandson of Yalies and now father of a current student, seems very proud that Yale is a part of his past. ??Kelly Wallace, CNN, New Haven, Connecticut. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: And looking now ahead to 2004: the Reverend Al Sharpton says that he will explore seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ?The civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in Florida in the last presidential race. ??If he runs, Sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives, and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?Sharpton ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1994 and for mayor of New York City in 1997. ??Reverend Sharpton and former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer will discuss President Bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on ""CROSSFIRE."" That's at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. ??Another note from New York: a state supreme court justice today barred Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion. ?The judge ruled in favor of Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, who had requested a restraining order barring Judith Nathan from the residence. ?The ruling says that Nathan may not enter the residence as long as the Giuliani children continue to live there. ?The judge also denied Giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??And we'll have the latest on President Bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: This evening, the Senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?Republican leaders hope to give President Bush the tax cut for approval before Memorial Day. ?But as Jonathan Karl reports, taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??JONATHAN KARL, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Senate's $1.35 trillion tax cut would be the biggest in a generation, but don't spend your tax windfall yet. ?Most of the cuts will not take effect for several years to come. ??Relief from the so-called major penalty will not start until the year 2005. The estate tax won't be repealed until 2011. ?That means even if President Bush is re-elected, it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his second term. ?The IRA contribution limit would be raised from $2,000 to $5,000, but that also wouldn't happen until the year 2011. ??The tax cut calls for doubling of the child tax credit, but that takes 10 years too. ?The credit would rise from $500 to $600 this year, slowly increasing in $100 increments over the next 10 years until it finally reaches $1,000 in the year 2011. ?The cuts in income tax rates would be phased in even more slowly. ??SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA), FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You are right, some of them do not -- are phased in over a period of time. But there is real relief in this tax bill for every taxpayer starting January 1, 2001. ?They don't have to wait until next year. ??KARL: That immediate tax relief amounts to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples filing jointly, but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is still to be worked out. ?The option favored by the president is a simple rebate check sent directly to taxpayers, an idea opposed by many Senate Republicans who call it impractical. ??But the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut, which Democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. ??SEN. KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: This plan is fully back- loaded. ?That means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?This decade it cost $1.35 trillion. ?In the next decade, it will cost from 3.5 to $4 trillion. ??KARL: But there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?The tax cut includes a sunset provision, that means all the tax cuts in the bill would expire in the year 2012. ?For the tax cuts to remain in place, Congress would have to pass them again. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??KARL: Now, the Senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today, paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the Senate tonight. ?But it will not end there. ?This still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in House, the House passing almost exactly the president's tax cut, including much deeper cuts in income tax rates preferred by Republicans. ??The Senate and the House will have to work out their differences. They're expected to do so this week, setting the stage to send this final tax cut down Pennsylvania Avenue and onto the president's desk by Memorial Day -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: Jon, when you talk about the plan providing 300 or $300 a year per individual, divided by 12, that's $20-some a month. Is this the kind of money the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people with higher gasoline prices? ??KARL: This was exactly what he had it mind. ?This was exactly what he was talking about, directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers, directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??This is an idea that his Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, strongly favors, the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?But one big problem with this, Judy, is that taxpayers over the course of time move, they change addresses, some of them die. The question is, how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?It's not an easy proposition. ??WOODRUFF: And Jon, one other subject, we know the president's nominee to be solicitor general of the United States has run into a real problem in the Senate committee. ?Where does that stand right now? ?The last we heard, the Senate Judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of Ted Olson. ??KARL: Well, the Senate leaders, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, are now actively involved in this, trying to come to some kind of an agreement, an agreement that will allow the Democrats to get access to some information they want about Olson, especially information that was compiled by independent council Robert Ray, looking to just what Olson's involvement was in that Arkansas Project by the ""American Spectator"" magazine, the investigation into Bill Clinton's personal life. ??They want information from the independent council to look at just how involved Olson was in that project, to see whether or not he was truthful in his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?There's some movement to try to get the Democrats on the committee more of the information, also maybe to release more of it to the public. ??If that's all done, it would set the stage for a vote on the Olson nomination before the full Senate, but probably not until after Memorial Day. ?The Senate goes on recess at the end of the week, they will be off all of next week, you probably won't see a vote on the Olson nomination until after they return. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Jon Karl at the Capitol, thanks. In the House of Representatives, Democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the Republican majority. ?Add to that, critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?And life in the House minority begins to look bleak. ?Our Kate Snow caught up with the House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to talk about the balance of power and his political future. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D-MO), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We need to say what are we for, and that's what... ??KATE SNOW, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dick Gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a Democrat these days, stuck in the minority without the backing of the White House. ??GEPHARDT: Well, you take what you -- what you are given. ?I mean, the people run this country. ?We don't. ?And so, you fight for what you believe in as hard as you can, and if you really believe in it, then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??SNOW: Gephardt says the Democrats are forced to play defense, responding to Republicans. ??GEPHARDT: I think we slowed down a little bit the amount of the tax bill -- not enough, in my view -- but we lowered it some so that the potential deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?I think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill, at least the substance of it, but we still haven't been able to convince him or the Republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??On energy, I think that we've got a very, very positive alternative that I hope people will listen to. ?People in California and Oregon and Washington need help now. ??SNOW: That was last week's theme. ?First at a gas station, the lawn of the Capitol the next day, and then in a underground war room. ??Gephardt is a master at staying on message, often spending hours talking to the press, his strategy: agree with Republicans when he thinks they're right and hammer at home when he disagrees. ??GEPHARDT: If we do not learn from history, we are forced to repeat it. ?This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. ??I try not to yell. ?I try to get ideas across as good a way as I can. ?But there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?You need to let people know that you really care about this. ?And you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?And I think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??SNOW: But is the strategy working? ??I have talked to some Democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. Some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?They don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?Do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? ??GEPHARDT: I don't. ?I think that -- I think the ranks and the Democratic Party are largely unified. ?They are marching together and working together in ways that I've never seen them before. ?I always tell them that it's me and we. And we have to be a team. ??I would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens, but largely, I think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in Washington. ??SNOW: How much of your days are spent thinking about 2002 in the next election? ??GEPHARDT: Well, I want to win the majority back. ?I think it's really important, not for the party and not for me, but for the country. ??SNOW: Is it more important to win back the majority than it is to win legislatively for the next couple of years? ??GEPHARDT: I think it is in the House for sure, because the minority is really out of power totally in the House. ?You have no ability to bring up amendments, you don't set the agenda every day. And that is real power in the House. ??SNOW: There is a lot of focus on 2004, a lot of talk about your ambitions, do you have plans to run for president? ??GEPHARDT: I really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you, then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?And my goal is to win back the majority in the Congress in 2002. ?I think, as usual in our system, we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president, but that is not what I'm doing and not what I should be doing. ??SNOW (voice-over): Gephardt insists he's not planning ahead, though he's scheduled to attend four events in New Hampshire in two weeks. ??GEPHARDT: The future will take of itself. ?I have no idea what will happen, and I'm not worried about it, and I don't spend time worrying about it. Because, again, I've got to do this in 2002. ?This is what we're trying to do. ??SNOW: So, are you committed to staying minority leader through 2002? ??GEPHARDT: Absolutely. ?I'm totally committed to winning this House back, and I think we are going to do it. ??SNOW: Speaker of the House, you said to me last fall that that had a nice ring to it? GEPHARDT: It works for me. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Kate Snow talking with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. ?They talked today. ?And later this week, Kate will sit down with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ?You can look for that report on Friday. ??On another term for the another high-profile Republican and two nationally known Democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??INSIDE POLITICS will be right back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??To no one's surprise, Charlton Heston was reelected today to an unprecedented fourth term as president of the National Rifle Association. ?The 77-year-old actor was chosen at the NRA's annual convention in Kansas City. ?The group changed its rules last year to allow Heston a third term, and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him, once again. ??Former Attorney General Janet Reno may be looking for a new line of work. Now back in her native Florida, Reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??JANET RENO, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I love Florida very much. I was born and raised there. ?I have lived there most of my life. ?And I want to make sure that I do everything I can, either as governor or otherwise, to serve the interest of the people of Florida. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Reno says she does not believe that her Parkinson's Disease would keep her from running, and she expects to make a decision before the end of the year. ??Governor Jeb Bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??House Minority Whip David Bonior may trade in his Congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?The 13-term Congressman from Michigan filed his paperwork today to become a candidate in Michigan's 2002 governor's race. ?His aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?With Michigan slated to lose one House district, Bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's Republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?Republican Governor John Engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??Californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?We'll check new poll numbers from the Golden State, and discuss power politics in the state when we return. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: At ground zero on the energy crunch: more than half of Californians say they disapprove of the way President Bush is handling that state's power woes, according to a new poll. ?But the survey shows more Californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies, former Governor Pete Wilson and current Governor Gray Davis than on President Bush and the federal government. ?The Democrats are trying hard to convince Californians that Republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?Here is a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that begins airing in Los Angeles today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??NARRATOR: California's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. Yet President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?His spokesman saying, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter"" and our representative, Stephen Horn, has joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?Call Congressman Horn and tell him we need action now. ??That is if you can find the phone. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The Democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot, part of a month-long radio and TV ad campaign targeting Republicans on energy. ?Let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that Public Policy Institute of California poll we just told you about, Mark Baldassare joins us now from San Francisco. ??Mark, first of all, this poll finds Californians pessimistic in general, did that surprise you? ??MARK BALDASSARE, CALIFORNIA POLLSTER: It did. ?For the past three years, we've been in an incredible time of optimism in California. ?Two-thirds of Californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?Most Californians felt that economic times would continue to be good, and most Californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. For the first time, we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state, about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??WOODRUFF: And why do you think that is? ??BALDASSARE: Well, eight in ten Californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most Californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of Californians say it's a big problem and moreover, a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?So there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty, people are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??WOODRUFF: So you're saying because of the electricity crisis, if you want to call it that in California, it's now driving people's views of everything: population, the economy, across-the-board. ??BALDASSARE: We -- for the past few years people have been focused on improving the schools, for instance. ?Now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?And we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. ??WOODRUFF: Explain for us, Mark, who people are blaming. ?We were -- Bill Schneider reported earlier on the program that Americans, overall, are having mixed views about to what extent President Bush is responsible. ?Here we're learning in California, they hold President Bush far less responsible than they do local leaders. ??BALDASSARE: Yeah, well, we are at time right now in California where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?They've certainly heard about them. They haven't experienced, for the most part, frequent rolling blackouts, but they hear that they're coming. And so when we talk about blame, people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?And for that, of course, they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?Now, as we go forward over the next few months, people are going to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in place, and that's why I think both the Democrats and Republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. ??WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, what is your reading on this? ?Are ads, like the ones we just saw the Democrats running out there, are those likely to have an effect on people's views? ??BALDASSARE: I don't think so. ?I think that what is will most going to have a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?And if people feel that these electricity hikes have really, you know, altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy, if they feel blackouts are really going to, you know, put them in an uncomfortable situation going through the summer, then my guess is they are going to give blame both to Bush and to Davis. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Mark Baldassare of the California Public Policy Institute. ?Thanks very much, good to see you again. ??BALDASSARE: Thank you. ?Same here. ??WOODRUFF: As California tries to ease its energy problems, there are concerns about the cost not only for consumers, but for the environment. ?CNN's Rusty Dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one California plant's effort to expand. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An aging giant known as the Mighty Moss. ?The 50-year-old Moss Landing Natural Gas plant along California's coast owned by Duke Energy. ?A face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state, providing 2.3 million homes with light, heat and air conditioning. ?But all that power takes water to cool the turbines, water that's home to otters, fish, herons and other wildlife. ??CAROLYN NIELSEN, PLANT OPPONENT: Every day, Duke will use 333 football-size fields -- pools of water that are 10 feet deep. ?That is just incomprehensible. ??DORNIN: Water from the wetlands run through the plant, returning to the ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?Been that way for 50 years. ?Now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??PATRICIA MATEJCEK, SIERRA CLUB: Everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams, diatoms, young fish, everything in it will be killed. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists say the Mighty Moss got a break on the approval process, as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. It took 14 months. Permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??KAITILIN GAFFNEY, CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION: It's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. ??DORNIN: But here's the twist as part of the permit process: local environmental groups signed off on the Mighty Moss renovation plan. ??GAFFNEY: So at the eleventh hour, we were able to work out this deal with Duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. ??DORNIN (on camera): Duke Energy will spend more than $8 million expanding the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. There will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??TOM WILLIAMS, DUKE ENERGY: This will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. This state is in an energy crisis. ?The new plant we're bringing on is cleaner, more efficient than virtually any plant in the country today. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists made a deal here, but many fear, in a power-hungry state, taking what they can get may be their only option. ??Rusty Dornin, CNN, Moss Landing, California. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: A very different kind of power politics, circa the 1970s, is being seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?Former President Ford is honored for granting a famous -- some would say infamous -- at pardon. ??That's next on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: It is something that many Americans that lived through the Watergate era might never dream they would see. ?An award named for a Democratic icon presented to the man who angered many Democrats by pardoning Richard Nixon. ??CNN's Bruce Morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG, JOHN KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: He placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?We are honored to present you, President Ford, with the John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award for 2001. ??(APPLAUSE) ??BRUCE MORTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gerald Ford, now 87, got the award because, as a new unelected president, he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the Watergate scandal. ??RICHARD M. NIXON, 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. ??MORTON: ""Our long national nightmare is over,"" the new man said of Watergate. But really, what would end it? ?Nixon could still face charges. ??GERALD FORD, 38TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My conscience tells me that only I, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book. ??MORTON: And so he granted: ??FORD: A full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. ??MORTON: Many Americans thought that was a mistake. ??SEN. TED KENNEDY (D), MASSACHUSETTS: I was one of those who spoke out against his actions then, but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?And now we see that President Ford was right. ??MORTON: Not everyone agrees. ?Ford's press secretary at the time, Gerald Ter Horst, resigned to protest the Nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??JERRY TER HORST, FORMER FORD PRESS SECRETARY: He was going to go off scot-free, whereas all of his minions -- the people who worked at the White House, from the chief of staff on down to Ehrlichman, Chuck Colson and others -- they were going to have to do prison time; they were not going to get pardons. MORTON: And it may have cost Ford the 1976 election. ?It was a close election. Many things could have swung it, but the pardon was surely one. ?Jimmy Carter, who beat Ford, thanked him Inauguration Day. ??JAMES EARL CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land. ??MORTON: Accepting the award, Ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by ""partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy."" ??FORD: I sense a longing for community, a desire on the part of Americans to be part of something bigger, finer than themselves. ??MORTON: Historians may still argue about the pardon. ?They agree he cared about his country and its politics, and did what he thought was right. ??Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Also cited for political courage today, Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia who was beaten, as he and others challenged segregation during the freedom rides through the South in 1961. ??Lewis was given a special Profile of Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. ??Former president Ford, Congressman Lewis and Caroline Kennedy will all be guests tonight on ""WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.""

Rhapsodic Lawmakers; Legislature: Speaking frankly, officials have used the wiener as an easily digestible metaphor for the state's energy crisis. BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI, MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Every crisis has its symbol. ??Watergate had Deep Throat. The S&L scandal had Charles Keating. O.J. did--or didn't--have a bloody glove. ??Here in the Capitol, the hot dog has become an unlikely metaphor for the state's energy crisis. ??In packed news conferences and heated Assembly floor debates, lawmakers from both parties have evoked images of the ordinary dog to help explain an extraordinary mess. ??The genesis of this statehouse trend is difficult to determine. Assemblyman Fred Keeley appears to be the first to have tossed the hot dog into the political fire. ??During a crucial Assembly discussion in January, the Boulder Creek Democrat recited the lyrics to a familiar Oscar Mayer jingle as a way of admitting that a controversial bill to have the state buy electricity to avoid blackouts was unpalatable, but necessary. ??""It's the dog kids love to bite,"" said Keeley of the jingle. ""Well, this is the bill people love to hate."" ??A bizarre, partisan hot dog duel ensued. Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) responded by likening the unpredictable financial consequences of the Keeley legislation to biting recklessly into mystery meat. ??""Before I bite into it I see what's on the outside, but I can't see the inside,"" Campbell said. ""If nobody can tell me what's on the inside, it may be bitter, it may be bad, it may make me sick."" ??Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) angrily fired back, wanting to know why Campbell, a professed hot dog eater, was suddenly so critical of its unknown contents. ??""It's OK to eat a hot dog that's full of animal bones and hair,"" Migden said. ""That's a hot dog that's OK with you, but this kind of hot dog isn't."" ??Yet it was Senate leader John Burton who made it the key ingredient in a Capitol catch phrase. ??Burton described a plan to purchase the electrical power grid from the state's private utilities as a fair swap, saying: ""I give you a dollar, you give me a hot dog."" ??The sound-bite quickly took on a life of its own. With the cost of the energy crisis growing faster than the price of ballpark franks, critics doubted the public's appetite for a multibillion-dollar hot dog. ??""Do you really want a hot dog? That is the question,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group for power generators. ??Not content to let a dog lie in its bun, lawmakers such as Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) kept the hot dog in public discourse. ??When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection, Leonard was one of a chorus of legislators who questioned the merits of purchasing the remaining portion of the power lines, calling it ""not even half a hot dog."" ??Added Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park): ""It's like paying Mercedes prices for a broken down hot dog cart."" ??In recent weeks, the hot dog rhetoric appeared to have gone cold. Then Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) revived it. ??After enduring hours of testimony on details of the deal to purchase Edison's power lines, Vargas said his opinion of the dollar-equals-hot-dog deal had diminished. ??""They're trying to charge us for a hot dog,"" Vargas said of the utility, ""but it looks like we're only going to be getting a wienie."" ??Reliant Vice President John Stout also recently weighed in with his own hot dog analogy as he tried to explain why his company's income had jumped so much during the crisis. ??""If you have a hot dog stand and you go out and buy five to six more hot dog stands,"" Stout said, referring to his company's purchase of power plants, ""then naturally you would expect the operating income to go up."" ??Alas, the dog days of summer have yet to begin.

A1 LENGTH: 835 words HEADLINE: Davis asks U.S. to limit firms' prices; RATE SWINGS: Governor argues 2 generators manipulated market SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill DATELINE: Sacramento BODY: Gov. Gray Davis pursued a new strategy yesterday to control wholesale electricity costs by demanding that federal regulators ban two generators from selling power in California at market rates, arguing that they have manipulated the market to their advantage. ???Meanwhile, the Davis administration lambasted a federal plan to implement temporary price controls, scheduled to go into effect Tuesday. State officials said the measures would do nothing to tame California's out-of-control costs for electricity. ???Davis, whose calls for broader price limits on wholesale electricity have been rejected repeatedly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is scheduled to meet with President Bush next week to ask Washington to do more to help California. ???""Federal regulators said that prices were 'unjust and unreasonable' nearly nine months ago, but they have been AWOL ever since,"" Davis said in a statement. ???The California Independent System Operator, managers of the state's electrical grid, asked energy regulators yesterday to revoke the authority they have given Williams Energy and AES Inc. to sell power at market-based rates. Instead, the Davis administration wants the companies to be forced to sell at cost-plus rates, which would ensure a reasonable but limited profit. ???""Market-based rate authority is not an entitlement,"" the ISO said in a filing with federal regulators. ???The ISO asked regulators to act by June 15, saying that any delay ""places California consumers and the state's economy at extreme peril."" ???Similar filings against other companies, such as Mirant, Duke and Reliant, are being considered, said Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO. ???Robinson said the ISO has a ""well developed"" record of price manipulation by the two companies. He said information previously given to federal regulators proved the prices charged to California were excessive. ???'GRANDSTANDING' ACCUSATION ???Aaron Thomas, a spokesman for Virginia-based AES, said the administration is grandstanding. ???""This is akin to the rhetoric the governor has used for the past several months,"" he said. ""We are well below the index FERC uses to establish concerns about market power. ???""As to this rhetoric about these companies abusing the marketplace -- check the facts. We lost money last year,"" Thomas said. ???A spokeswoman for Williams said the company would not comment because it had not seen the filing. ???Earlier this month, Oklahoma-based Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle charges with FERC that the company was purposely withholding electricity from California's power market. The company admitted no wrongdoing, and officials said a full hearing would have cleared the company. ???If the regulatory commission denies the state's requests, or doesn't ""act in the time frame we believe is necessary to prevent harm,"" the state can appeal to a circuit court, Robinson said. ???BUSH VISIT POSTURING CHARGE ???Jan Smutny-Jones, head of the Independent Energy Producers Association, said the move is posturing by Davis ahead of Bush's visit. ???""This is an interesting welcome mat for President Bush,"" he said. ""Do we want a dialogue or a diatribe?"" ???In advance of Bush's visit, Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday that nothing more can be done to help solve California's power problems this summer. ???He also rejected price controls, saying that previous efforts have contributed to a supply shortage. ???A spokesman for Davis rejected that notion and denied that the timing of yesterday's announcements were connected to the Bush-Davis meeting. ???Davis aides expressed hope that Bush's two new FERC commissioners, Pat Wood III, a close Bush ally expected to take over the chairmanship of the board, and Nora Mead Brownell, a state utility regulator in Pennsylvania, would hear California's pleas. The two new commissioners were confirmed yesterday by the U.S. Senate. ???Among the things Davis wants changed is the regulatory commission temporary price relief plan scheduled to take effect Tuesday. ???The regulators would limit wholesale prices during power alerts in California, when reserves drop below 7 percent of available capacity. ???Many state officials believe that doesn't go far enough. The state Assembly, in documents to be filed Tuesday, said price controls should cover all hours -- not just power emergencies. ???And there is a chance the controls will be in effect for just a few days. Under the regulatory commission plan, the state and the three investor-owned utilities must file a proposal to join a regional transmission organization by June 1. If they do not to do so, the price controls disappear. ???Davis administration officials expect to file another response dealing with the regional transmission organization by Friday, Robinson said. The Assembly filing rejects joining such an organization, which federal officials favor as a means to better manage and improve grid capacity in the West.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL On the eve of a meeting Tuesday between President George Bush and California Gov. Gray Davis, top advisers to the governor said the state could be pushed into recession unless the federal government imposes temporary price caps to contain soaring wholesale electricity costs. President Bush has consistently opposed price caps. The governor's team called a Memorial Day news conference to highlight what they saw as the dangers to the economy of the state, and possibly the nation, from the tens of billions of dollars being spent this year to purchase electricity. The governor's aides estimated that statewide, wholesale electricity purchases this year could hit $50 billion compared with about $7 billion in 1999. Some estimates for this year's power expenditures are even higher. If California were a separate nation, ""an energy shock of that magnitude would be expected to cause a significant recession,"" said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the conference. While being part of a broader national economy could somewhat mitigate the impact, the higher power costs are ""a recipe for stagflation in California,"" added Mr. Blinder. ""Stagflation"" refers to stagnant economic conditions and inflation -- a condition that struck the nation when energy prices soared in the 1970s. Though the advisers painted perhaps the dreariest outlook yet to come from the governor's office, they said that the Davis plan for financing the state's electricity purchases remains intact. As reported, the state plans to sell about $12.5 billion in bonds later this year. The state has been purchasing electricity since January, when its failed utility-deregulation plan left California's two biggest utilities financially unable to continue buying power. If price caps were instituted, the state might have to borrow less money than anticipated or at least face a decreased danger of having to borrow more if the power situation gets worse, said Joseph Fichera, chief executive of New York-based Saber Partners LLC and an adviser to Mr. Davis. The governor plans to press his case for price caps over the next six to 18 months, as supplies are increased with new power plants due to come into operation, the advisers said. However, Mr. Bush and other federal officials have repeatedly said that they believe price caps would be counterproductive and discourage the building of new power plants. Write to John R.

Robert Hillman BODY: ??LOS ANGELES _ President Bush landed in hostile territory Monday night, beginning his first presidential visit to California amid a pressing energy crisis that he says he cannot ease in the short term. ??""We welcome him to California,"" said California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat who has waged a long-distance war with the Republican president over the high cost and short supply of electricity in the nation's most populous state. ??""I hope he has an opportunity to talk firsthand to some of the people who are adversely impacted by the very high rates we're paying for electricity."" ??But the president's carefully scrubbed schedule for the next two days provides little time for such an opportunity, although he will confer privately with business leaders to discuss high-tech solutions to the state's energy problems. ??Arriving on a cross-country flight that touched down in Arizona for a Memorial Day tribute, Bush headed off to prepare for an early-morning stop Tuesday to promote energy conservation at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton and a luncheon address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??On Wednesday, he'll visit Sequoia National Park near Fresno, Calif., to launch a new drive to clean up and fix up national parks. ??He'll also meet privately Tuesday afternoon with Davis in what the Los Angeles Times characterized as a ""peace summit."" But no major shifts in policy are expected. White House aides suggest that the meeting will be a success if the governor even temporarily tempers his sometimes-harsh words for the administration. ??""The president's focus is going to be on solving problems. He's not interested in finger-pointing,"" White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. ??""Whether people agree, or disagree, with the specifics of his energy plan, I think most Americans and most Californians are very pleased to see a president who is leading and taking action in addressing the issue head on."" ??However, recent public opinion polls show the president and the governor taking hits for the energy crisis in California. ??The Field Poll, finished a week ago, found that 54 percent of those surveyed believed Bush had handled the energy problems poorly, with Davis faring somewhat better at 38 percent. The margin of error for the 1,015 California interviews was 3.2 percentage points. ??An earlier survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found Davis' job approval rating plummeting, from 63 percent in January to 46 percent in May, as the state's energy troubles escalated. Bush's overall approval rating was higher at 57 percent, but still just as many of those surveyed gave him low marks for his handling of energy issues. That margin of error, for 2001 interviews, was 2 percentage points. ??In short, political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said, Bush's visit to the state _ in his 19th week as president, after already visiting more than half the other states _ is long overdue. ??""His not responding, or not being perceived to respond, to the short-term needs of California has allowed Davis' arguments to resonate _ that the federal government is uncaring, is insensitive,"" Jeffe said. ??In his national energy policy unveiled nearly two weeks ago, Bush offered a series of mostly long-term recommendations to conserve energy, find more of it and substantially upgrade and expand the nation's oil refineries and transmission systems for natural gas and electricity. ??Davis, complaining that Texas energy companies in particular are gouging Californians, has urged Bush to embrace price controls for wholesale electricity, but the president has steadfastly refused. Vice President Dick Cheney, who oversaw development of the White House energy policy, emphasized as recently as Friday that there's no quick fix on the way for California. ??""Long term, the answer is to build more power plants, and that's exactly what they're doing,"" Cheney told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""But they're not going to have enough new capacity online this summer to avoid blackouts."" ??So the energy woes continue to fester in California. It's not just electricity and rolling blackouts. Gasoline prices of $2-and-more-a-gallon have become commonplace as well. ??""The gas bothers me more than the electric,"" said Tait Kmentt, who runs a legal process serving business in Irvine, Calif. ""Gas prices are killing me."" ??At $2.25-a-gallon for premium gasoline, he says, it costs him more than $40 to fill up his new Mercedes _ with no relief in sight. ??A newcomer to the state, Kmentt voted for Bush last fall and said he's glad the president is finally visiting California. But Kmentt cautioned, ""This will be a big test to see how concerned he is."" ??Kmentt said he understands the state's energy troubles are a ""huge problem that can't be fixed overnight,"" and right now he's blaming the power companies for the high price of electricity. ??""I just think the public is being lied to,"" he said. ??Still, this is not good news for Bush, who has been increasingly portrayed by Democrats as a Texas oilman still beholden to the industry. California, which he lost last fall to Al Gore by 12 percentage points, has become increasingly a political headache. ??Where his predecessor, Bill Clinton, seemed politically and personally comfortable, Bush is not, suggests Jeffe, a senior scholar in the School of Policy, Planning and Development at the University of Southern California. ??""An ego cannot be buoyed by losing the state by 12 points,"" she said. ""We are the state that was responsible for giving Al Gore his popular vote victory."" ??With the Senate now headed for Democratic control, Jeffe said, Bush's visit to California _ and others that will surely follow _ are essential to help Republicans hold their base in the House. ??If the energy crisis persists in California, further punishing its economy, the ripple effects will certainly spread, she said. ??""George Bush remembers the influence of the economy on the career of an incumbent president,"" Jeffe said, pointing to Bush's father, who was defeated by Clinton during an economic slump in 1992. ??""It took a while,"" she said, ""but people are beginning to get angry."" ??(c) 2001, The Dallas Morning News. ??Visit The Dallas Morning News on the World Wide Web at http://www.dallasnews.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: DA LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ??????????????????????May 29, 2001 Tuesday ?Home Edition SECTION: California; Part 2; Page 1; Metro Desk LENGTH: 1178 words HEADLINE: Governor to Stress Price Caps to Bush; Power: In a meeting today with the president, Davis will present a letter from economists backing cost controls and demand federal assistance. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis will present a letter to President Bush today from top economists advocating wholesale electricity price controls, warning Monday that a failure by Bush to help California solve its energy crisis could signal to other regions that he may ignore their pleas. ??Bush, making his first trip to California, has set aside 20 minutes this afternoon to meet with Davis in Century City. In an interview with The Times, the Democratic governor vowed to repeat his request that the federal government move to cap wholesale power prices. Failure to act swiftly threatens the state and national economy, Davis said. ??""I want him to understand,"" Davis said, ""that if California has to pay 700 times more for electricity in 2001 than it did just two years ago, it could well drag our economy into a recession and could conceivably trigger a national recession. That is not good for anyone."" ??In the letter, 10 economists, including Cornell professor emeritus Alfred Kahn, a major proponent of airline deregulation, told of their ""deep concern"" about the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to stabilize wholesale electricity prices in California. The economists faxed the letter to the White House on Friday afternoon, and provided the governor with a copy to present to Bush today. ??""FERC's failure to act now will have dire consequences for the state of California and will set back, potentially fatally, the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country,"" the economists, led by Frank Wolak of Stanford University, wrote. ""Moreover, this negative experience with electricity restructuring could delay or reverse current efforts to introduce competition into other formerly regulated industries."" ??Davis called the letter ""very significant validation of what we've been saying: The marketplace is not working and FERC has an obligation to act."" ??""We're not pleading for relief; we're entitled to it,"" Davis said. ??Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly have said such controls never work. In California, caps might worsen the situation by limiting supply, they have argued, resulting in more blackouts this summer when demand for electricity is highest. ??The Bush-Davis meeting has had all the buildup of the political equivalent of a title fight: On one side, the Democratic governor of the nation's most populous state, which Bush lost by more than 1 million votes in November. On the other, the new president, coming off a roller coaster week of political defeat (the shift in control of the Senate) and victory (passage of his tax-cut plan), whose work in the Texas oil industry gives him a special history in the topic at hand. ??From afar, Davis has battled the Bush administration's energy policy. But, said Dan Bartlett, one of the president's chief communications advisors, ""The president has some interesting views on this topic as well, with some experience himself."" ??Bush's Energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, took steps Monday to increase electricity transmission capacity in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Energy Department that is responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states, to finish its planning for extra transmission capacity. ??At issue is so-called Path 15, an 84-mile stretch of power lines with insufficient capacity to carry the necessary load between Southern California and the northern part of the state, especially during peak hours. The central question is whether financing is available for a new transmission line. ??Davis lauded the action but said the president needs to do more. ??""If I have any advice to him of a political nature, it is take a chapter out of President Clinton's book. ??"" [Clinton] was very attentive to California, and as a result did better in 1996 than he did in '92. People felt he was here for us when we needed help. We need help."" ??Davis said that on a recent trip to Chicago, officials there worried that if Bush ""won't offer California some relief, he may not offer us relief,"" in a catastrophe. ??Among the facts and figures Davis intends to show the president is a chart showing that California paid $1.2 billion for electricity in the first quarter of 1999, $1.8 billion for the same period last year, and as much as $10.3 billion for electricity in the first three months of this year--at a time when conservation efforts had been taking hold and demand was down. ??""I hope the president will be as stunned as I am,"" said Davis, who is watching as the state spends more than $55 million a day to buy electricity that private utilities can no longer afford. ??Davis said that though he is trying to speed construction of power plants, encourage conservation, and return the private utilities to financial stability, the federal government has control over wholesale power prices. ??""Therein lies the final piece of this puzzle,"" Davis said. ""If it falls into place, we're on the way to putting this issue behind us. If it doesn't fall into place, it could create real economic havoc here and across the country."" ??Davis said that if Bush refuses to impose price controls, he should ""find some way to help us, consistent with his own belief."" ??""Turning a deaf ear not only won't be well received here,"" Davis said. ""It likely won't be received well elsewhere."" ??The state's energy crisis has posed a ticklish dilemma for Bush's busy travel schedulers: Had he visited earlier, it would have been awkward not to focus on energy issues. But until 11 days ago when a task force led by Cheney produced energy proposals, there would have been little Bush could say. ??Karen Hughes, the president's counselor, made it clear that regardless of the pressure, Bush will not yield on price caps. ??""We want to help. The president is very concerned about the energy situation and blackouts,"" she said. But limiting the wholesale price of energy would only discourage its production,"" Hughes said. ??California is the 30th state Bush has visited since taking office Jan. 20. His staff said the delay had to do not with energy issues but with politics and geography. ??With the administration focused in its first months on winning approval of the tax cut, the president's travels were largely dictated by that effort, his aides said. ??Besides, the president confided recently, even with Air Force One at the ready, it just takes too long to fly from Washington to California. ??Still, Hughes said, the president is not ignoring California. Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security advisor and a former Californian, sits next to Hughes every morning at the daily meeting of the White House senior staff, she said. ??What's more, the president ""has many friends in California,"" Hughes said, adding: ""Ernie has a home in California these days."" Ernie is the Bush family cat that is living with a friend in Brentwood while the First Family lives in the White House. ??* ??Times Staff Writer Massie Ritsch contributed to this story.

BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: McKITTRICK, Calif. BODY: ??You could think of this as California's own little slice of west Texas. ??Here in the scruffy brown hills of western Kern County, oil rigs grow more easily than trees, pickups are more common than cars, and chicken fried steak is the most popular dish at Mike and Annie's McKittrick Hotel. ??The hotel--which no longer offers lodging, just food and drink, and plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone Star construction camp. Just down the road, a mammoth electrical power plant is rising out of the sagebrush, its generators housed in four boxy buildings the size of airplane hangars. ??It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years, an electrical construction boom unmatched anywhere in California. Kern, which already has a large surplus of electricity, is cementing its place as California's energy capital, assuming far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained power supplies. ??Over the next several years, the county will add nearly 5,000 megawatts of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports, on average, from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five counties the size of Kern, which fills the dusty southern rim of the San Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662,000. ??In some parts of the state, a proposal to build a new power plant is a call to throw up the barricades. In recent months, intense community opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plants in South Gate and San Jose, although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive plans for the San Jose plant. ??You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County. ??""There should be power plants in everybody's backyard,"" said Paul Gipe, chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club, which did not oppose any of the new plants. ""If people are concerned about having too many power plants, they should think twice when they flip on the light switch."" ??New, natural gas-fired power plants, Gipe reasoned, are relatively clean and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution problems. Ideally, he said, they will allow the state to close some older, dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage. ??If environmentalists don't oppose the plants, it's not too much of a leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them. ??Just try, for instance, asking somebody in Taft, an oil center south of McKittrick. ""It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look at it,"" said Pamela Dunlap, who runs a downtown thrift shop. ??An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry ??She stood in the twilight outside her shop, on a street that embodies many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or war heroes in prominent public places, Taft has erected small oil rigs and other pieces of drilling machinery, a reminder of its economic roots. ??That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is, perhaps, not surprising. ??To begin with, there's geography. Kern stands astride California's major north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which they divide between the service areas of Pacific Gas & Electric, which serves Northern California, and Southern California Edison. That spot can be pinpointed as the Midway substation, a vast jungle of humming wires, transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow. ??Already, massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the coming months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant, the one near McKittrick; and Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant, just south of Taft. ??The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines, which will be tapped to run the plants. In fact, Kern contains the state's largest known reservoirs of natural gas. ??Another of Kern's geographic advantages? ??""You look around, and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living around here,"" observed Stephen Whaley, who is overseeing construction of the Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills, an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in the morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape, bisecting a crisscross of steam pipes, fuel lines and electrical wires. ??""This area is all about oil,"" Whaley said. Casting a glance at the modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him, he added with a wry smile, ""You know, I guess you could look at this from the road, and you could make the argument that it improves the looks."" ??The Sunrise plant, a relatively simple single-cycle plant, is expected to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1, a scant nine months after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years, assuming all receive final approval. ??The lack of major opposition to the plants is, of course, another reason developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long had a more intimate relationship with energy--oil, gas, electricity--than most places. To people here, the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb, or an oil derrick and a gas pedal, is neither theoretical nor especially threatening. They're comfortable with energy. ??Kern produces more crude oil than any other county in the United States outside Alaska. Property taxes from oil companies have helped build handsome new schools in Bakersfield, the county seat and largest city. The companies' big payrolls have helped populate elegant subdivisions with names that sound vaguely Houstonian: Seven Oaks, River Oaks, Landmark Estates. ??Which brings us to the Texas connection. ??It's hard to overlook it, in a county that runs on oil and cotton and boasts a country music scene to rival Austin's. Conversations in the finer Bakersfield restaurants are filled with references to trips to Texas, of colleagues in Midland and Odessa. A Bakersfield radio station was running a contest recently: The winners would be flown to a bull riding championship in Houston. ??Until December 1999, American Airlines offered direct jet service between Bakersfield and Dallas. It stopped after Occidental Petroleum moved its headquarters from Bakersfield to Houston. ??This is a county where President Bush received more support in the November election than he did in Texas, his home state. But then, Bush already had a Bakersfield connection: He lived there briefly as a child when his father, former President George Bush, worked in the Kern oil fields. ??""You look at the topography around Bakersfield, and the county's morals and ethics--that predominantly conservative attitude that we have around here--and you look at the oil, and you could be in Midland,"" said John Allen, the general manager of Occidental of Elk Hills, which is developing a power plant in tandem with Sempra Energy of San Diego. ??A lot of people in Kern County will tell you they don't mind being an energy farm for the state. It's a living, after all. ??""It's good to be working at home,"" said Joe Ryan, a Bakersfield pipe welder who has spent years on the road seeking the heavy construction work that seemed to have vanished in his hometown. Now he's working at the La Paloma plant, a 1,048-megawatt behemoth that will come online in phases beginning in December. ??About 800 people are at work on the plant, and several hundred more will be employed in the coming months. And after that plant is done, there will be others to build. ??""This is a good job here, I tell you what,"" said Ryan, 47, who has been banking his overtime on six 10-hour days a week--sometimes more. ??County Sees Itself as 'Part of the Solution' ??But there are some signs of simmering resentment, especially among county leadership. After all, if every other county produced just half the electricity that Kern generates, California wouldn't have an energy crisis. And people in Kern County are getting hit with the same spring-loaded electricity bills, the same rolling blackouts as everybody else. ??""I think the people of California are either going to be part of the solution or part of the problem,"" said Assemblyman Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield). ""And in Kern County, we have a long history of being part of the solution, especially when it comes to energy issues."" ??Elsewhere in the state, Ashburn sees ""a lot of arrogance--people who enjoy the benefits of a very high quality of life, enjoy the benefits of electric power for jobs and for their personal life, but with an exclusivity that it's someone else's problem to create that for them. We don't have that attitude in Kern County."" ??Power Buildup in Kern County ??Six new major gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years, making the county the power capital of the state. ??* ??RELATED STORY ??Letter to Bush: Gov.

SANGER DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 28 BODY: ??Days after he suffered the biggest political setback of his four-month-old presidency and then won the tax cut that he staked his campaign upon, President Bush traveled tonight to California, carefully calibrating how to deal with the state's energy crisis. ??After Memorial Day celebrations in Washington and Mesa, Ariz., Mr. Bush began his first visit as president to the most populous state, which he lost by roughly 12 percentage points in November's election. The visit seems likely to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and political strategies. ???Mr. Bush will meet briefly on Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis, who will insist, as he did again today, that the federal government impose price caps on wholesale electric power. ??The White House says Mr. Bush will refuse, again. He will argue that such caps would only discourage increased production of electric power. ""We think that's a mistake,"" Vice President Dick Cheney said on Friday, talking about why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the administration made public 10 days ago. ??But Mr. Bush knows that how he handles the California energy crisis could prove critical to his political fortunes, especially now that his party's loss of control in the Senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major elements of his energy plan. ??Moreover, the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high energy prices is a tax cut, because that is now legislative history. As one of his aides said this weekend, after Congress approved the $1.35 trillion tax cut that will be phased in over the next 10 years, ""we will have to turn now to the other arguments."" ??Most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow California in a partial deregulation of the market, with disastrous results. ??Repeatedly Mr. Bush has chastised California's politicians, and by implication Mr. Davis himself, for ignoring politically unpalatable choices to avert the state's power-generating crisis. Ten days ago, standing in front of a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush used the state as Exhibit A for his argument about what happens when population rises, when over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the stringing of new transmission lines, and when politicians fail to plan for the long term. ??""The problems in California shows that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence,"" Mr. Bush said then. ??At the same time, his aides were pointing to polls showing Mr. Davis's approval ratings plunging. They did not mention that Mr. Bush's ratings in the state were hardly any better. A series of recent polls show that roughly two-thirds of Californians believe Mr. Bush should be doing far more to help the state, though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. ??So Mr. Bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day visit here, trying to find ways to differ with Mr. Davis without seeming callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. ??The betting is that Mr. Bush will focus on long-term solutions, in contrast to Mr. Davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. ??The effort started today. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued an order of chiefly symbolic importance, saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state. ??""The level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year,"" the Energy Department said. It said that it would proceed with studies of how the land could be acquired, by eminent domain if necessary, and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. ??But Mr. Abraham left wide open the question of whether Washington would go ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. ??""The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,"" Mr. Abraham said. ""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??The statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with Mr. Davis, which will be closed to the press. So will a meeting with energy entrepreneurs. (Mr. Bush passed on Mr. Davis's suggestion of a forum with small-business owners and residents who have seen the lights go out.) ??Few expect Mr. Bush or Mr. Davis to change his mind about energy caps after their meeting. ??But for Mr. Bush it will not all be tough love. On Tuesday morning Mr. Bush is scheduled to travel to Camp Pendleton to repeat his call for the military and other federal users of power in California to flip off their switches whenever possible. But given his own comments, and Mr. Cheney's, about the limited utility of conservation, that order could strike some Californians as a little hollow. ??Later he will give a trade speech in Los Angeles, underscoring the message that if California hopes to remain the world's greatest exporter of high technology -- if it were a nation, California would be the world's sixth-largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver electricity. ??Already, leading Silicon Valley companies are threatening to build their next-generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere, probably in Texas, which has a surplus of generating capacity, a move that would further undermine Mr. Davis's stewardship. ??In fact, Mr. Bush's Texas roots will never be far from the political battlefield here. Mr. Davis has accused Texas energy companies of profiteering at California's expense. To press the case, he has hired two political operatives from the Clinton White House, Marc D. Fabiani and Chris Lehane, who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the case for price caps. ??California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, also a Democrat, suggested to The Wall Street Journal last week that some time in jail would be the best way to deal with one of Mr. Bush's biggest supporters -- Kenneth Lay, who heads the Enron Corporation and has sought to influence the selection of members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ??The comments may have been partly facetious, but they were not interpreted that way here. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ??????????????????????????The Orange County Register 29, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K7500 LENGTH: 825 words HEADLINE: California's power crisis generating lots of heat BYLINE: By John Howard BODY: ??SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Detectives would seem to be tripping over each other to discover who did what to whom, and why, in California's energy crisis. ??While electricity may be scarce, investigations are plentiful. A dozen major probes are afoot, many overlap, and more loom. The atmosphere is heated, the rhetoric strong. State, federal and local investigators, along with court officers, financial experts and special investigators, are poring over thousands of pages of documents from government agencies and private companies. ??At the top of the swarming heap is the $10 million investigation mounted by the state Attorney General's Office to answer the core question: Did a handful of power sellers fix prices to bilk Californians of billions of dollars? ??But it's not just the government that is busy. The companies themselves _ which have categorically denied any wrongdoing _ are overwhelmed by the scrutiny. ??""We are supplying reams and reams of documents. ... It is a distraction from our day-to-day work, there's no question,"" said Tom Williams of North Carolina-based Duke Energy, which operates several power plants in California. ""It affects our employees and their families, this barrage of innuendo. I don't know what more we can do."" ??Accompanying the investigations are at least a half-dozen lawsuits against the companies by individuals. Like the probes, the suits contend the companies improperly manipulated the market. Legislative leaders, meanwhile, have sued the federal government, contending it has failed to protect consumers from price-gouging. ??""This all permeates our business in so many ways,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western States Power Forum, a group that represents power sellers and buyers in the West. ""It even affects my ability to talk to the newspapers, because we're afraid statements may turn up later and be used as evidence. We're not sure what we're dealing with, whether a suit or even a grand jury if the (attorney general) decides to take criminal action, as he said he might."" ??The state's top prosecutor said that, indeed, criminal charges are a possibility. ??""There is an investigation under way that involves potential criminal conduct,"" said Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer. It could be at least eight weeks before that probe is completed, she said. ??Other investigating agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission, the city attorneys' offices in Long Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco; California's grid manager, the Independent System Operator; the obscure Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the ISO; and the state Senate and Assembly. ??The state has even considered asking two more federal agencies, the Department of Energy and the Federal Trade Commission, to get into the act. Some offices are conducting multiple investigations. In the case of at least two agencies, the PUC and the Attorney General's Office, the investigations are being at least partly coordinated. Some agencies are examining the same issues. The PUC, the attorney general and ISO, for example, all are looking at whether power plants were shut down to drive up demand and prices. ??""There is a lot of overlap and there probably are problems of coordination,"" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco, a grass-roots watchdog group. ??With so many agencies trying to extract information, Hoge said, even those who have done no wrong are concerned about talking freely because of the greater likelihood that proprietary information will leak to competitors. ??Others feel the overlap is beneficial. ??""When you're up against an industry as wealthy and powerful as the energy industry, it's probably better to double-team them,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ??Hoge believes that if any investigation is going to produce results, it will be Lockyer's, ""because the governor has thrown all the resources that way."" ??Investigators have requested mountains of paperwork. Transaction and maintenance documents, market reports, financial records, even e-mails _ all have been sought. ??Martin Wilson, a spokesman for Texas-based Reliant, contends the intensity of the probes could have negative long-term effect on California's business climate. ??""There is a climate of instability and uncertainty that makes companies rethink their decisions about investments (in California),"" he said. ??But for consumer groups, the goal of all these investigations is straightforward. ??""Certainly, we're really hopeful that these investigations will lead to refunds for customers,"" said TURN's Mindy Spatz. ""There is a widespread belief among people who follow these issues that widespread gaming and manipulation has occurred in the market."" ??(c) 2001, The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ?????????????????????MAY 29, 2001, TUESDAY, FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Those that weren't blamed it all on that most familiar of modern scapegoats, the computer. ???Computers must be kept cool -- in the 60s for big mainframes and a bit more for the smaller units most folks use, though some can go into the 80s without hiccuping. So generally, people who work alongside the computers get to keep cool, by association, although it's the computer that counts. ???The ISO headquarters, located in an industrial park 20 miles east of Sacramento, is a delightfully cool and comfortable place when the outside temperature soars into the 90s and 100s. ???The reception area, the only room accessible to the outraged public, is a fairly stiff 76 degrees -- only two degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush and the federal energy crisis czars and czarinas. ???But take a step past the lobby security doors and the temperature plummets. In the main hallway, the temperature is 73 degrees. And in the control room, where two dozen engineers and technicians sit at consoles and monitor the flow of California electricity on a giant diagram of state power lines so they can order blackouts for everyone else -- the temperature is 69 degrees. ???NO SWEATING AT ISO ???Some managers do not take off their sports coats and jackets. ???""We want these people to be comfortable,"" explained Tony Capasso, facilities manager for the ISO complex. ""We don't want these people sweating bullets in the middle of a crisis."" ???Inside the state Capitol, where legislators and the governor preach compliance with federal guidelines calling for 78-degree thermostats, the temperature dips into the high 60s. The coolest spots are the press briefing room and the treasurer's old office. ???GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ???The governor's suite is in the mid-70s, apparently because folks are often coming by with thermometers and it wouldn't do not to set an example. Press secretary Steve Maviglio said Governor Gray Davis is a practice-what-he-preaches kind of guy who keeps corridors dark, shades drawn, air conditioners idle. His personal secretary works in short sleeves, with a cheap plastic fan humming nearby. ???""It's so dark in the hall that we're always bumping into things,"" said one aide. ???Even so, the temperature in the governor's suite of offices is three degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush -- not the first time the two men have failed to agree. ???THE LEGISLATURE ???The Assembly chamber is 71 degrees while the Senate chamber -- with 40 fewer legislators spewing forth -- is 73 degrees. But the Senate chamber has a southern exposure, one Capitol guide explained. ???""Hot air from the people sitting inside has nothing to do with it,"" he said. ???In San Francisco, the temperature inside cavernous City Hall dips in spots to the mid-60s. College student Jasmine Westbrook, who dropped by with her art class on a project to sketch the interior of the building, was doing her sketching while wearing a windbreaker to keep warm. ???""I want to stay comfortable,"" she said. ""It think it's supposed to be hotter in here, isn't it?"" ???The mayor's office, at 73 degrees, was eight degrees warmer than another office down the hall, even without the mayor sitting in it. ???63 AT THE PUC ???At the headquarters of the state Public Utilities Commission, which is supposed to be keeping an eye on the self-declared bankruptcy of the utility that mails out the bills, the lobby temperature is 63 degrees. ???Chief engineer David Omosheyin, eyeing The Chronicle's thermometer nervously, insisted the 63-degree reading was caused by the lobby's proximity to the front door, where the outside temperature at the moment was in the low 60s. He invited the thermometer to visit the upper floors, where the temperature was 70. ???As for San Francisco's federal buildings: Bush would probably not frown. ???His orders appeared to be followed during The Chronicle's visits, so much so that it was actually hotter inside than out. Though that wouldn't be hard, considering it was in the low 60s outside. And the places measured happened to be courtrooms and tax offices, where the body heat from anxiety alone could probably melt the paint some days. ???San Franciscans, Omosheyin said, are losing their perspective when it comes to things like electricity, energy alerts and rolling blackouts. In his native country of Nigeria, he said, the electricity runs sporadically, if at all. ???""There the power can go off for a week,"" he said. ""The world goes on. Here, people take a lot of things for granted, and electricity is one of them."" ???As for the offices of the places that report on such matters, they fared about the same. ???The Walnut Creek bureau of The Chronicle, where the sun sizzles into the 90s with regularity in the summer, is kept at 67 degrees because of all the computers. The main newsroom of The Chronicle is kept at 71 degrees, because of all the computers.

Brad Sherman, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks who met Air Force One on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport along with a group of high school students, wasted no time button-holing the president for what appeared to be an animated conversation. ???""I brought up . . . the idea that after his meeting with our governor, I hoped he would be in favor of wholesale regulation (of energy prices),"" Sherman said later. ""He disagreed with me."" ???Sherman -- who two weeks ago suggested that the headline to the president's national energy policy should be ""Bush to California: Drop Dead"" -- didn't seem optimistic yesterday about Bush's 48-hour visit to the state. ""I think that the president's policies show either a lack of understanding of what's really going on in California, or a lack of concern,"" he said. ???That vignette underscored some of the challenges facing Bush, who arrived in California as protesters geared up and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis prepared to press him for federal action on the state's power troubles. ???Besides Sherman, Bush was greeted by a crowd of cheering Republicans, including Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the former a declared GOP candidate for governor in 2002, the latter a rumored one. ???But today, Bush will sit down with the present governor, who lately has been blistering in his criticism of the president. ???""The last time I looked, California was still part of the United States of America,"" Davis told reporters this weekend. ""We have contributed disproportionately to the economic growth of this country. There's no reason why a president should not respond to a legitimate request from the chief executive of the largest state in the union."" ???In his first visit to California since just before the election, Bush plans to emphasize the energy crisis -- but will focus on it through the lens of his own energy plan. ???ENERGY SECRETARY ACTS ???Just hours before the president landed, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham ordered a speedup in planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electricity transmission line in California. ???Abraham's holiday action was timed to provide a bit of positive news for Bush to announce in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of the Energy Department, to complete planning and seek outside financing to reduce the transmission bottleneck on California's Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???This morning, Bush will visit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities. ???In Los Angeles, he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affairs Council and lead a discussion among business leaders about technological advances in energy conservation. ???Then, he will head to Fresno and Sequoia National Park to press his initiative to improve national parks. Along the way, protesters have vowed to provide a vocal commentary on Bush's energy and environmental policies. ???But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush and Davis today. The governor pushed for a lengthy, open meeting with Bush that would include testimony from officials and consumers affected by the energy crisis. Bush's camp announced Friday the meeting would be 20 to 30 minutes -- in private. ???Davis plans to outline steps the state has taken to alleviate the energy crisis, and what it wants the federal government to do -- including implementing price caps on the wholesale cost of energy, cost-based pricing, and the possibility of ordering refunds. ???DAVIS THREATENING SUIT ???The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it does not impose temporary price caps. ???And the state Legislature has already filed a suit, saying the commission has failed to stop what it has determined are ""unjust and unreasonable prices."" ???With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts predicted, the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls for both leaders, both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of their handling of the energy crisis. ???Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California, a state that gave a 12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election. ???But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that the president had arrived to show he cares, Vice President Dick Cheney again chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis ""because all of the action was potentially unpleasant."" ???And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price caps, saying, ""We think that's a mistake."" ???Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's troubles and only underscored the perception of an ""all-oil, all-the-time ticket."" ???Davis, whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling of the crisis, has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energy firms, particularly those from Texas, in recent weeks. ???And yesterday, signaling no letup, Davis' supporters made an unusual holiday conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued that without immediate intervention from the Bush administration, the economy of California -- and potentially the entire nation -- was at risk. ???'THIS ENORMOUS SHOCK' ???""We have this enormous shock in prices that needs to be addressed and not ignored,"" said Joseph Fichero, head of Sabre Partners and a consultant to Davis. ???Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that energy woes in California alone would ""take almost a half a percent of the gross domestic product off of the national economy."" ???Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months -- is necessary while new power plants are being built. ???""Most times and most places, I agree price caps are not the long-run solution, but they can be part of a short-term solution,"" Blinder said. ""There really is a case for temporary price caps to shield consumers and the California and national economy from the full force of the energy shock."" ???Limited new price caps approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the sale of wholesale electricity begin today in California. But the temporary caps, which go into effect when the electricity reserves dip below 7.5 percent, have been lambasted by Davis as ineffective and inadequate. ???Political analysts say Bush's resistence on the issue could cost him in California -- and elsewhere. ???""(California) is probably an area where he is criticized more than any other region in the country,"" said Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide Field Poll.

Gray Davis will urge President Bush today to back a 2-year cap on electricity costs as the best way to keep his power-starved state -- and possibly the U.S. economy -- from sinking into recession. ???The Democratic governor and Republican president, who have been sparring from afar over energy policy, will meet here to discuss their differences. The White House has said repeatedly that it opposes price caps as a way to deal with energy shortages in California. ??In an interview with USA TODAY, Davis said a limit on wholesale electricity costs is needed while the state attempts to build 15 new power plants. He said that would still allow a 30% profit margin. ??""While the president didn't create this problem, he is uniquely situated to solve it,"" Davis said. ""I'll make clear that he has an opportunity to relieve the pain and give California the breathing space to put more plants online."" ???Bush, making his first visit to California as president, unveiled a long-term energy policy this month that calls for increased production and, to a lesser extent, conservation. The president will promote conservation steps being taken by the federal government during a visit today to the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. ??""The president believes that imposing price caps will only make the problem worse,"" White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said. ??Davis, whose popularity has plummeted as Californians cope with blackouts to offset electricity shortages, said his state's problems could hurt all Americans if they are not dealt with quickly. ""I'm asking for some form of relief that reduces the outrageous prices we're currently bearing,"" he said. ""Without that relief, lots of people will lose their businesses, and California could well be dragged into a recession. Since we're about one-eighth of the national economy, that doesn't bode well for America."" ???The California Public Utilities Commission has announced rate increases of up to 50% for businesses and 37% for homes. ??Bush has sidestepped California after losing the state by 12 percentage points to Democrat Al Gore last year in the presidential election.

A03 LENGTH: 1936 words HEADLINE: It's Still Dawn for Solar Power in L.A.; Despite City Subsidies, Homeowners Hesitate to Install Expensive Alternative Energy Source BYLINE: William Booth, Washington Post Staff Writer DATELINE: LOS ANGELES BODY: ???One year ago this city announced its intent to become ""the Solar Capital of the World,"" with 100,000 roofs covered with solar electric panels by the end of the decade, an audacious goal to transform the homes of this smoggy but sunny metropolis into miniature power plants. ???To fulfill what is perhaps the nation's most ambitious solar campaign, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power began offering substantial ""buy down"" subsidies that would reimburse rate payers for half the price of each new solar energy system. For the average home, a photovoltaic package costs between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000, parts and labor included, before the rebate. ???How many have been installed? ???At last count, about 40. ???That leaves only 99,960 rooftops to go. ???The Bush administration, and especially Vice President Cheney, architect of its energy plan, have been criticized for skepticism regarding alternative energy sources. But a close examination of the Los Angeles solar experiment and a review of similar programs suggest the former oilmen in the White House have a point: Solar, at least, has not proven ready for prime time. ???For all of Los Angeles's good intentions, and for all of solar's many positive attributes, the problems of harnessing its power remain. Some of those challenges are economic and some technological; others are more mundane, but often ignored, such as finding a qualified contractor a homeowner can trust to drill dozens of holes in the roofs to mount the things. ???In a reprise of the 1980s, solar again is hot. The price of photovoltaics is dropping and interest is growing. Other states such as New York, Arizona, Florida and Washington are moving to join California in major efforts to wire homes to draw power from the sun. ???But as many Americans are beginning to understand, the delivery of energy is like a complex, interconnected assembly line, and the devil lurks in the details. ???The Los Angeles experiment tells the story shared by other locales. In L.A., for example, the city's lone solar panel manufacturer has not been able to supply enough systems to meet demand. ???The systems, too, are often oversold by solar proponents. In the real world, most do not pay for themselves in a few years, as some advocates claim, but take 20 years or more to return their initial cost in the form of reduced utility bills. ???Nor are the systems maintenance-free: At a minimum, the rooftop panels must be routinely cleaned of pollution, dust and leaves. ???They cannot be installed efficiently on homes without shade-free, south-facing roofs; the shadow from a neighbor's palm tree can frustrate the system's photovoltaic cells. ???Nor will the most common systems allow buyers to live ""off the grid,"" unless they want to purchase a large bank of batteries. Even with the batteries, homeowners probably would not be able to run their washing machines and air conditioners at the same time. ???""It is not an economic proposition at this point,"" conceded Terry Peterson, a solar expert at Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif. But one day, Peterson predicts, 100 years from now, solar energy will provide a substantial percentage of the world's energy needs. In a decade or two, the cost of solar will likely be competitive with other energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear or coal. ???But now? It is still a luxury item. ""Like buying a swimming pool,"" Peterson said. ???""I really like the idea of running my house with solar power,"" said Andrew Chin, a potential customer in Los Angeles who has been researching a purchase. ""But they're still pretty expensive, even with the rebates, and so I gotta ask myself, what am I doing this for,"" his conscience or his wallet. ""I'm thinking I might wait until they work the kinks out."" ???The most knowledgeable and experienced solar contractor in Los Angeles is probably Graham Owen, the founder, owner and single full-time employee of Go Solar Co. ???His installation of a one-kilowatt solar electric system on a home in the San Fernando Valley was the first to be awarded a rebate by the Los Angeles power department in March. ???How many systems has he installed as part of the rebate program? Three. ???But Owen is a true believer, and over the next year, he plans to cover hundreds of roofs with solar panels. On his shelf, Owen still has an unreturned library book, ""The Coming Age of Solar Energy,"" published in 1963, and checked out from his high school in Lennox Hills, Ill., in 1979. ""I guess we're still stuck in the coming age of solar energy,"" he said, smiling. He recalled that the buzz about solar water heaters in the 1980s led to disappointment with shoddy workmanship and less than spectacular energy savings. ???Until recently, there has been little widespread interest in solar electric power. Since 1998, the California Energy Commission has been pushing its own program to encourage homeowners to erect photovoltaic panels on their roofs, offering to subsidize about one-third of the cost. ???Across a state with a population of about 35 million, only 450 solar energy systems have been installed on homes. ???Then the California energy crisis struck, with its power interruptions and steep rate increases, and the phone calls began to overwhelm Owen's voice mail. ???""On days with rolling blackouts? I get a hundred calls, maybe more,"" Owen says. His Web site, www.solarexpert.com, is now receiving 3,000 hits a day. Customers are begging him to do jobs. ???The Los Angeles power department reports a similar surge in interest since the energy crisis began six months ago. ""Customer demand has shot through the roof,"" says Angelina Galiteva, executive director for strategic planning at the Department of Water and Power. She estimates that her department receives 1,000 calls on some days about its solar subsidy program. ???Yet while the reliability and cost of solar electric technologies continue to improve, solar power today accounts for only a sliver of the national pie chart of energy production -- less than 1 percent. The country produces about 300 megawatts of electricity with solar -- about the same amount produced by a single mid-sized traditional power plant. ???The current trend for photovoltaics is not to erect large centralized solar farms in the desert, an experiment that withered in the 1980s, but to pursue ""distributed generation"" or individual units on scattered rooftops. ???The problem has consistently been the cost of the solar panels, which has been too steep to justify them, except for customers who are committed environmentalists or techies who like the elegance of the systems. ???Los Angeles began its solar experiment after Sacramento legislators mandated that utilities spend about 3 percent of their revenue on efficiency, conservation and renewable energy. For solar, the power department committed $ 75 million over the next five years -- enough to subsidize panels on 7,500 homes. ???The power department will pay $ 5 for each watt of solar installed on a residence or business. Homeowners typically purchase a one-kilowatt or two- kilowatt (1,000 or 2,000 watts, respectively) solar electric system, meaning that the municipal utility would pay between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 of the cost up front -- an enticing, tax-free offer. ???""For many years, I wanted to do solar, but it was so expensive,"" said LaWanda Geary in the San Fernando Valley, who in April had Owen install 32 panels for a two-kilowatt system on her sunny roof. ""The rebate really got me going. I don't know many times when the government offers to pay half of anything."" ???The systems that are eligible for rebates must be tied into a utility's electric power grid, meaning that during the day, when the sun is shining, the panels are adding a stream of electrons used by the home to run its lights and appliances. ???If there is a surplus of solar power, that electricity goes back into the power lines and is passed along to a neighbor, and the electric meter at the house actually runs backward. Homeowners, however, are not selling their excess electricity -- they're giving it away to the utility company. ???On cloudy days, and at night, the home is not being powered by solar energy, but getting its electricity the traditional way from the power lines. ???Calculations on savings vary. A two-kilowatt solar system can supply an average-sized home with 20 to 80 percent of its electrical needs, depending on how many lights, appliances and air conditioners are running, and how efficient they are. ???After the subsidy, and depending on how the system is paid for (in cash or with borrowed funds), a solar system can pay for itself in as little as six years and as much as 36 years. Owen assumes about 20 years. ???Potential solar clients, moreover, often mistakenly assume that going with the sun will take them off the grid, which is not possible without a large bank of batteries that costs several thousand dollars more. Because the solar panels are still wired to the power grid, if there is a blackout, the power in a solar house goes off, just like everyone else's. If uninterrupted power is needed, Owen suggests a diesel generator. ???Galiteva does cite one real advantage of solar: It reduces the electricity that must be purchased from power companies and protects, to some degree, a solar home from the full brunt of upwardly spiraling rate increases. Unfortunately for solar enthusiasts, the L.A. Department of Water and Power, which was not deregulated along with the three other major utilities in California, has perhaps the cheapest and most stable supply of electricity in the state, making the economic argument harder to make. ???To receive the full $ 5 per watt subsidy, the L.A. Department of Water and Power requires a homeowner to purchase solar panels from a manufacturer based in the city. The idea is not only to become the solar capital of the world but also to encourage local growth of an emerging industry and create jobs. ???One hitch is that no solar panel makers were located in Los Angeles. ???After lengthy negotiations, Siemens Solar Industries, based in Camarillo, Calif., an hour's drive to the north, announced in February that it would open a solar panel manufacturing plant in Los Angeles. But it is not a complete facility: The L.A. plant does only some final assembly and then the units must be returned to Camarillo for final testing and shipping. ???Tina Nickerson, a spokeswoman for Siemens Solar, estimates her company has sold ""a couple dozen"" to L.A. homeowners for the rebate program. But she, too, reports that the interest from consumers is sometimes overwhelming and that supply has been a problem. Most U.S.-manufactured units are shipped overseas to places such as Germany, Japan and Scandinavia, which have had generous subsidies in place for years. ???LaWanda Geary had to call Siemens herself to push them to deliver panels for her house -- and she was eligible for the rebate because of a stopgap compromise that allows to Siemens to ship solar panels from Camarillo until its L.A. plant is fully operational. ???Everyone involved concedes there have been bottlenecks. Siemens now says it has enough panels to begin to meet demand, and Owen and the city are hoping things will sort themselves out, especially if more solar manufacturers are drawn to Los Angeles. But proponents worry about what will happen when the subsidies run out. ???""Selling solar is now the easy part,"" Owen says. ""I could sell a hundred a week. It's getting them up on the roof that's the hard part."" LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ????????????????Copyright 2001 News World Communications, Inc.

And the winter came, and they stopped reproducing. ?And then, somewhere around February or March, I learned about something called 'spring emergence.' As the ground got warmer, the larvae turned into flies and more medflies started appearing. It got out of hand, and ultimately I had to order malathion spraying. ?It would have been better had I taken forceful action at the first notice of the medfly."" ??Mr. ?Foster asked: ""Are you saying that the governor missed opportunities to act early, in the same way?"" ??Mr. ?Brown replied: ""There's an analogy there. ?I didn't want to spray because I knew the people in Santa Clara County didn't want to have helicopters spraying malathion over their homes. ?It didn't sound good. ?As governor, I wouldn't have wanted to see rate increases either. ?But sometimes you have to take your medicine early. ?It's less bitter than if you postpone it."" ??Mr. ?Davis served as Mr. ?Brown's chief of staff when the latter Democrat was governor. ??ENERGETIC CRITICISM ??President Bush's energy plan, already under fire from Democrats and environmentalists, is dismissed by National Review, the conservative magazine, as so much political posturing. ??""The hyperbolic attacks on the Bush plan by environmentalists (as an attempt to poison the air and kill the caribou) shouldn't trick conservatives into an exaggerated sense of its merit,"" the magazine says in an editorial in its current issue, dated June 11. ??""The basic thrust of the administration's thinking on energy is sound: a growing economy requires more energy, which in turn entails more production. But the Bush plan itself is a political document, meant to placate corporate interests, environmentalists, and everyone in between, and so is festooned with an embarrassment of subsidies and incentives that will, at best, prove an irrelevance. ??""As Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute writes in this issue, the phantom energy crisis is already healing itself. ?Power plants are being built at a rate that outpaces Dick Cheney's benchmark of one plant a week. Altogether, almost 100,000 new daily megawatts of electrcity capacity are scheduled to be available nationwide by next year. ?This is twice the amount of electricity that California now uses on an average day. ?While Cheney has been sitting with his advisers around a White House conference table, investors and entrepreneurs have been digging, building, and refining his energy problem into oblivion. ?By the time all the Bush plan's tax credits have kicked in, there may well be an energy glut. ?All of this is thanks to the most efficient energy plan known to man: market pricing."" ??WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS ??""The buzz in the media after Sen. ?James Jeffords' switch put Democrats in control of the Senate was that President Bush must change his ways. ?He has to become more moderate. ?Why? ?Because only that will prevent more Republican defections and it's the president's one hope for getting his agenda through Congress. ?This is wrong on both counts,"" Fred Barnes writes in the Weekly Standard. ??""Bush and GOP congressional leaders bent over backwards to accommodate Jeffords and liberal Democrats on education, the senator's top priority. Jeffords bolted anyway. ?On taxes, Bush stuck with his conservative tax cut until nearly the end, when he compromised just enough to assure passage.

Both Mr. Bush and Vice President Richard B. ?Cheney, who on Friday again blamed the state government of California for the energy crunch, oppose cap measures. ??In his first visit to California since the presidential election, where he lost the state to former Vice President Al Gore by 54 percent to 41 percent, Mr. Bush hopes to sell his national energy policy to a vocal group of opponents. But the hue and cry has been muted of late since residents have battled rolling blackouts and sky-high gasoline prices. ??A new poll released Friday shows 59 percent of Californians, many of whom have been longtime foes of nuclear energy, now believe the non-polluting energy source may be the way to solve the state's problems. ??Mr. ?Davis' popularity has plummeted. ?The Democrat, facing re-election next year and often mentioned as a presidential candidate, is viewed as having ""poor job performance"" by 60 percent of Californians, according to a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??In a small gesture to California, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham yesterday announced plans to increase transmission capacity in California, which he said would be a ""big step"" in easing rolling power blackouts. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration - an Energy Department arm responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states - to wrap up planning for building extra transmission capacity. ??The governor has repeatedly blamed Mr. ?Bush, who took office four months ago, for the energy crunch in California. ?He points the finger of blame far outside the state's boundaries, primarily at Washington and Mr. Bush's home state. ??""The people that have dropped the ball are the federal government,"" Mr. Davis said last week. ?""They need to reimpose a price cap because we're being obscenely gouged by price gougers out of Texas and the Southwest. ?. . . There's a massive transfer of wealth going on from ordinary citizens in California to Texas."" ??Mr. ?Davis has also charged that utility companies are withholding power in order to drive up prices, a claim the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has investigated and dismissed. ??Mr. ?Bush and Mr. ?Cheney have often pointed out that California is second only to Rhode Island in conservation efforts, but the state is on the brink of an energy supply collapse. ??Still, despite the state's failure to build new power plants, Mr. Davis says California is entitled to a federal bailout approved by Mr. Bush. ??""I'm going to keep asking him to do it because we're part of America. The state, the last three years, has led American economic growth. ?. . . We're doing everything we can out here,"" he said. ??In the Democratic response to the president's weekly radio address, Mr. Davis accused the president, a former oil man, of being concerned only with the petroleum magnates. ??""With all due respect, I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive responsibility to ensure that energy prices are reasonable,"" he said. ??Many analysts, however, blame the state's deregulation scheme and failure to construct adequate electrical generating capacity. ?The price wholesale power providers can charge utilities is not capped, but the fee those companies can charge users is capped - resulting in massive debt for providers. ??The state was slow to respond to increased demand, the analysts say, even though the state is building 10 new power plants, four of which will come on line this summer. ??In his national energy policy, Mr. ?Bush lays out 105 proposals that focus on increasing domestic supply, improving the nation's ability to move energy between regions and increased conservation. ?But the policy is geared more toward long-term solutions - such as decreasing America's reliance on foreign oil - than short-term relief for Californians and motorists nationwide. ??Mr. ?Cheney, who heads the president's energy task force and said Friday that California knew ""for more than a year"" about the impending energy shortage, has promoted nuclear power as essential to America's energy needs. ?He said that at least some of the 65 power plants that need to be built annually to meet future electricity demand ought to be nuclear. ??A poll by the Field Institute last week found many Californians now agree. Although nuclear energy produces 20 percent of the nation's energy, California has just two nuclear plants.

Gray Davis on Tuesday. Bush's aides said he will pledge to cooperate with California but will stick to his position that no action by the federal government can prevent the rolling blackouts that are expected this summer. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of his department, to complete planning and seek outside financing for an increase in transmission capacity that he said would be ""a big step in the right direction, and a big step forward for Californians."" ??""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight,"" Abraham said in a news release.

""We can never measure the full value of what was gained in their sacrifice. We live it every day, in the comforts of peace and the gifts of freedom."" ??Bush also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ??Later he traveled to Mesa, Ariz., to pay tribute to veterans at the Champlin Fighter Aircraft Museum.

Gray Davis doesn't want to hear: He won't force down soaring electricity prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January. ??The Republican president and the embattled Democratic governor arranged a 20-meeting Tuesday to talk about California's energy crisis, but there was no indication they would break their stalemate. ??Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy, arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of the crisis. ??Davis contends federal energy regulators are ignoring their mandate to ensure ""just and fair"" electricity prices. ??With no sign of a break in the deadlock, each side maneuvered for maximum advantage from Bush's first full day in California as president. ??Davis, in an interview Tuesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" defended his record on licensing more power plants. ??""We've licensed 15 plants. Ten are under construction, four will be online this summer, four next summer, and by the end of 2003 we will have built our way out of this problem. But between now and then, we are getting gouged unbelievably,"" Davis said. ??The Bush administration timed positive energy announcements to coincide with the president's visit. ??At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, Bush was announcing the expansion of a program that provides federal money to help low-income residents pay for power. ??Bush was proposing $150 million, in addition to $300 million already budgeted for a component of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to provide special help to cash-strapped residents of California and certain Midwest areas such as Chicago, a senior administration aide said. ??Bush was also reminding state residents of his order that military facilities in the state cut peak-hour usage by 10 percent. ??To alleviate an electricity bottleneck on a crucial south-north transmission path, the Department of Energy announced that the Western Area Power Authority will try to raise money from a variety of private and public entities to finance a crucial additional lines. ??""The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,"" said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. ""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight.

And he convened a panel of families he said have been victimized by the energy crisis in the same hotel where Bush was staying. ??Davis wants Bush to pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose stiff price caps. ??Tuesday, limited caps ordered last month by FERC go into effect in California, but only when electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent in the state - a step Davis called inadequate. ??Protesters planned demonstrations in Los Angeles and at Camp Pendleton, in San Diego County. ??Bush also arranged a speech on energy and trade to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and planned to president over a closed-door energy round-table discussion.

Gray Davis was to meet President Bush to press for a federal cap on energy prices. ??But Davis wasn't expected to win any concessions during the 20-minute Tuesday meeting where he's expected to point to Texas energy makers. ??Davis has appeared on national news programs attacking Bush for opposing price controls on wholesale electricity, and suggesting the president has ignored price-gouging by Texas-based electricity generators. ??""The president did not create this problem, but he is uniquely situated to solve it,"" Davis said Monday. ""What I'm going to ask him to do, with all respect, is to enforce federal law. The money that leaves this state goes directly to energy companies in Texas and the Southwest."" ??If Bush refuses to administer price controls as expected, Davis can use that as ammunition in his sparring with the administration. ??Bush has blamed California officials for the state's power woes and said price controls won't solve shortages. Instead, they said, Bush plans to stress his efforts to conserve energy in federal buildings and will bring one or two new initiatives to the table. ??One of them commits the federal government to helping organize a consortium to build more power lines for the state. ??Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham directed the Western Area Power Administration, a federal agency, to take the first steps to clear the way for building more transmission capacity between southern and northern California. That would help relieve a transmission bottleneck in the central part of the state. ??While this will not help this summer, Abraham said in a statement the line improvements, when completed, ""will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??The stakes of the meeting are high for both politicians. ??Davis, who has been mentioned as a Democratic challenger to Bush in 2004, wants federal help to solve an energy crunch that threatens rolling outages this summer and has cost state taxpayers nearly $8 million since January - the price of buying power for two cash-starved private utilities. And his plan to rescue one of those companies reportedly is faltering. ??Leaders of both the state Senate and Assembly oppose a $3 billion-plus plan to bail out Southern California Edison by buying its power lines, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. ??Bush, meanwhile, needs to mend fences in vote-heavy California. The Republican president lost badly here in November, and polls show most Californians dislike his handling of their energy crisis. ??Bush's Tuesday agenda was heavy on energy issues. At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, Bush was to highlight his order that federal agencies and installations cut back energy use. Then it was on to Los Angeles to discuss his energy plan in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??Bush was confronted by the issue virtually as he stepped off the plane Monday in Los Angeles. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles, escorted the Academic Decathlon national championship team from El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills to meet Bush. He told the president California needs regulation of electric generators. ??""The president seems to believe just by instinct that rate regulation reduces supply and also by instinct that all those in the energy industry are fair people who are not trying to game the system,"" Sherman said. ""Anyone who studies the facts in California knows that power is being withheld in order to drive up the price.""

Now that fact has not been lost on Governor Gray Davis who has accused the president of ignoring his state's power crisis. ?As ABC's Josh Gerstein tells us, Mr. Bush's visit could have major ramifications for his presidency and his party. ??JOSH GERSTEIN reporting: ??(VO) Since taking office, President Bush has visited 28 states, but until this week he had not found time on his schedule to visit the nation's most populous state, California. ??Mr. DAN SCHNUR (GOP Political Consultant): Because the state is going through such extraordinary times right now because of the energy crisis, his absence has been much more noticeable, and the discussion about it's been much more heightened. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) Democrats have begun an aggressive effort to paint the president and other Republicans as obstacles to resolving the energy crisis. ??Offscreen Voice: (From TV Commercial) President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ??Text: ??""The President...believe(s) that the issue is mostly a California matter..."" ??GERSTEIN: (VO) On Tuesday, Mr. Bush meets with California Governor Gray Davis. ?He, and other Democrats, want the federal government to impose caps on wholesale prices for electricity. ??Representative ANNA ESHOO (Democrat, California): Our people are hurting. We're bleeding in the sand. ?We need a tourniquet, and the president is the one that can do this. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) During his trip, President Bush plans to highlight the federal government's conservation efforts, but aides say he will not endorse price caps. ??Mr. TUCKER ESKEW (Director, White House Media Affairs): The president believes that capping wholesale prices would do nothing to lower demand, or increase supply, the two fundamental solutions to any energy problem such as this. ??GERSTEIN: Holding the line against price caps may have political costs. Most analysts give Mr. Bush little chance of winning California in 2004, but Republican congressmen there face re-election next year. ?So far, five of them have endorsed some kind of limit on electricity pricing. ??Representative RANDY CUNNINGHAM (Republican, California): We're in an extreme emergency right now. ?It takes extreme measures. ??Unidentified Woman: We are in rolling blackouts. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) While electricity may be in very short supply in California this summer, the president and politicians of all stripes are likely to find there's more than enough voter anger to go around. ?Josh Gerstein, ABC News, the White House.

58894,2000-09-10 21:07:00,CPUC Hearing in SD on 9/8,Mona L Petrochko,dasovich-j,"In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD. It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing. Speakers were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could cross-examine the witnesses. Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided. Michael Kahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated in some cross-examination as well. Speakers were: ISO: Kellan Fluckiger, COO Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee Cal PX: David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs Seth Wilson, South Coast Air Quality Management District: Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director CPUC: Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney SDG&E: Donald Garber ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the wholesale market: 1. Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00) 2. Lack of generation additions in entire west 3. Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to retain water in spring. 4. Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in August 5. Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound 6. Increased underscheduling from June-August ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 in July. Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been driven up in lower load hours. While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC to be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further reductions would have on the market. They conclude that such a reduction would deter new investment, preclude generators from recovering fixed costs of production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower imports). ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the following: 1. File for extension of price cap authority to FERC. 2. Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on generators for a significant portion of their capacity. 3. CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by UDCs 4. CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs 5. Maintain sufficient planning reserves. ISO Staff also stated that: 1. Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation a. Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load b. Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation c. Additional charge for real-time market transactions 2. Attract and expedite new resources MARKET POWER: While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the underlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting market power. Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to determine from the information they have. Secondly, the analysis they have done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the ability (opportunity) to exercise market power. Therefore, at one point or another, nearly every market participant has market power. Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak periods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in off-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal costs. No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned.",important

Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants th= at=20 gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,= =20 the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Willia= ms=20 Cos.=20 Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,= =20 company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.=20 It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Semp= ra=20 Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,= =20 the nation's biggest electricity trader.=20 A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchas= ed=20 some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guar= d=20 their positions.=20 This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th= an=20 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the= =20 wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for= =20 consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20 Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi= s=20 year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20 In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie= s=20 such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and= =20 others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20 electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20 trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20 electricity inventory.=20 Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20 trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,= =20 which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20 It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20 increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20 conditions.=20 Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One= =20 of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20 competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio= n=20 side of the business.=20 For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20 indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20 More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built= =20 by a handful of manufacturers.

59337,2000-09-14 19:00:00,Observations on the Hearings this Week,Jeff Dasovich,dasovich-j,"We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months. But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead. OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is increasing. The administration is hell bent on finding a ""fall guy."" The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out. His press release following the hearing renewed the call for ""refunds."" On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers. And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the ""gouging"" band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a ""real"" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel. Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit. He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure. IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered. In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides. In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered. In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.",important

""FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based electricity prices,"" said Governor Davis in a statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn. ""Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power."" Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action in recent weeks to provide rate relief. ""While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address,"" said the governor. ""No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems of California's wholesale markets."" Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising electricity prices in San Diego: On June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergency and rolling blackouts. On June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San Francisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective on the price and delivery of electricity. Report was completed, submitted to the governor and released on August 2. On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds. In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two California-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market, he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term. On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies. On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas & Electric. The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between 50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies. On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust. On August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising electricity bills. On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request by releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The President also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases. On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signed two bills into law on September 6, 2000. Please see attached letter (below). # # # SEPTEMBER 12, 2000 STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA The Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that seriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and businesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is the extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary services, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In San Diego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer, threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of residential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining California electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate freeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for the first time in our history. As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed California regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the damage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy to report that those measures have been adopted, although not without considerable resistance from self-interested parties. In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the state. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite generation licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution systems. I have also established a task force comprised of key state officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies. While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address. No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to ameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets. A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behavior of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and subjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful that California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current situation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all steps necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service infrastructure of California. FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and reasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based electricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the exercise of market power. ### OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR ---- A00:245 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 12, 2000 GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM SACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of Michael A. Kahn as chairman of the newly-created Governor's Clean Energy Green Team. The Team was created by Governor Davis' signing of AB 970 by Assemblywoman Denise Moreno Ducheny (D-San Diego) on Wednesday. Mr. Kahn, 51, of San Francisco, is the chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board, and he also serves as vice-chair of the California Commission on Judicial Performance. He has been senior partner and head of litigation at Folger Levin & Kahn LLP since 1979. Mr. Kahn has held numerous state and federal government appointments and assignments over the last 15 years. Mr. Kahn is the author of several articles and reports on litigation practice and Supreme Court history. He is a magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Kahn also earned master of arts and juris doctorate degrees from Stanford University, where he was an editor of the Law Review. After graduation, he served for a year as a law clerk to Judge Ben C. Duniway of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The signing of AB 970 established the Governor's Clean Energy Green Team, which works to streamline the process of creating new power plants to ensure that an adequate supply of power will exist to make a deregulated marketplace work. The Team does this by working with local governments, identifying environmental impacts, developing recommendations for low interest financing programs for renewable energy and obtaining input on natural gas supply, emission offsets and water supply. Members do not receive a salary. This position does not require Senate confirmation. # # # Julee Malinowski-Ball Edson + Modisette Associate 925 L Street Suite 1490 Sacramento CA 95814 916-552-7070 FAX-552-7075 jmball@ns.net",not important

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's Electricity Oversight Board has ordered the state's Power Exchange to hand over confidential information to the board regarding the trading activities of utilities, generation companies and other market participants who traded power at the exchange since June, according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. The subpoena marks the first time the state will gain access and learn how each company traded power in the day-of, day-ahead and block forward markets. Moreover, the EOB subpoena requests the CalPX release the names of the participants who traded power at the exchange since June to better understand how and why the participants conduct business in the various markets at the exchange. The CalPX has until Wednesday to hand over ""aggregate supply and demand curves, individual firm bid dates, final schedules for each firm by generating unit, injection point and take out point,"" from June 1 through September and continue supplying trading data through Nov. 1. In addition, the subpoena requests ""block forward trade positions by firm for June, July, August and September"" and that this information continue to be supplied through October and November. The subpoena is part of the state's ongoing investigation into California's troubled deregulated electricity market, which has resulted in high wholesale power prices in San Diego, landmark legislative action and accusations of collusion, price gouging and market power. Gov. Gray Davis ordered an investigation in June, when power prices soared to near record levels and rolling blackouts wreaked havoc in the Bay Area. The CalPX said it will comply with the EOB request and that a subpoena to access the confidential information is required according to the rules of the exchange. But the EOB will be required to protect the confidentiality of each trade it gains insight into as well as the identities of the participants who traded. If the trading activities of a company or other participant is leaked or becomes public it could have a devastating affect on the company and the EOB would be held liable, according to the CalPX. The CalPX said it must notify each and every participant who traded power in its various markets to alert them of the EOB subpoena. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Folder Name: Utilities, Electric: Retail Wheeling Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 53 To review or revise your folder, visit Dow Jones CustomClips or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their ""rate reduction bonds"" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline. ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 09/27/2000 11:45 AM ----- ""Dick S George"" <dsgeorge@firstworld.net> 09/27/2000 08:04 AM To: ""Dick George"" <dsgeorge@firstworld.net> cc: Subject: WSJ: PG&E's Huge losses... CC list suppressed... September 27, 2000 California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL California's two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the state's deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months. If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the ""too big to fail'' response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks. Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills. Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New Plants Aren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11) Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, From Deregulation (Sept. 6) California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs (Sept. 1) ""If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can get through it,"" says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch IBCA. ""If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very serious situation."" Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: ""At some point, you have a financial crisis."" The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and don't envision problems in servicing their debts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. The California utilities' experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers. For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility that serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion. It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping $250 million from the commercial paper market. ""This is going to be a long, tough road,"" says Jim Scilacci, chief financial officer for Southern California Edison. Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when California deregulated its energy market on March 31, 1998, which opened electricity pricing to competition. California tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison, to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system. To do this, the state legislature set retail rates at high levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses for the utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. By the end of this June, PG&E and Edison together had collected more than $12 billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31, 2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point, rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market. But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale power prices surged, topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers. Average prices at state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier, and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers. The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E, that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by Oct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7 billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities. Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net worth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they have been accumulating deficits, aren't required to report these as losses on their earnings statements. That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers. But should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get clobbered. That is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's more, they can't use the proceeds from planned power-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, should the freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refunds could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the amount is $254 million. Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity. Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie Hoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up. Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess, which was drafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to ""overanalyze"" the ""old deal."" Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement, since ""it's in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper."" Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers ""mutually assured destruction"" to both utilities and ratepayers. Something must be done, he says, or consumers throughout most of the state will experience ""a San Diego-style rate shock."" The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & Electric Co., ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers. Legislators intervened this summer, however, and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is also accumulating a deficit as a result. So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analysts say. ""Until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise, our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole,"" says Richard Cortright, a director at Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group. But that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result: lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral. ""You're talking about top-rated companies, though,"" said Ms. Woodland of Fitch IBCA. ""To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen."" In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under long-term contracts at fixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-market volatility. And they have petitioned federal regulators to declare California's market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and, even, ordered to pay refunds. Nevertheless, several forces are working against them. Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remain high for those as well. What's more, they can't buy less power than their customers need. If they don't buy enough, the California Independent System Operator, the organization responsible for reliability, will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill. Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison, though, is one of timing. The California legislature is out of session until December, and regulators haven't even really started to address the issue formally. In the meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of millions of dollars daily. Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com",important

Electricity Crisis Cools Down a Bit in San Diego County, Calif. Dan McSwain ? 09/26/2000 KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: North County Times - Escondido, California Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) An uneasy aftermath has settled over this summer's power price shocks in San Diego County, punctuated this weekend by cool weather and falling electricity prices, as the state and federal policy-making apparatus shifts from a season of panicked damage control to the extremely difficult question of what to do next. In the parlance of the electricity industry, these are the ""shoulder"" months; a breather between periods of heavy demand for summer cooling and winter heating in which power-generating plants are typically pulled out of commission for trouble-shooting, overdue maintenance and refueling. California's pioneering deregulation of its electricity industry lies in a state of exhaustion. Guarantees from politicians of greater efficiency and lower prices have collapsed this summer into chronic power shortages and a historic transfer of wealth that in about 90 days moved $10.6 billion from the buyers of electricity to the sellers. Optimism is in short supply as a fractious collection of stakeholders and the nation's political and regulatory institutions begin to search for solutions. Emergency legislation approved by state lawmakers in August will temporarily reduce bills for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. from an average $146 in September to about $72 per month. In July 1999, San Diego County and parts of south Orange County became the first region in the nation under deregulation law to directly pay the wholesale price of electricity. Cool weather has caused demand for power to sag this weekend, bringing prices down from their lofty summer peaks to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour on Friday. But while the legislation has capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for SDGOcustomers, the utility will continue to pay the volatile wholesale cost of power, which averaged 21.4 cents this month. Historically, prices have fallen to as low as 1 cent per kilowatt in the winter months, but this year prices seem likely to exceed 6.5 cents for most of the year, and take off again in summer 2001. Analysts say generating and power marketing companies will retain their ability to raise prices, called market power, because their costs are higher and supplies of power are tight in the Pacific Northwest. SDGOsays the legislation could create a shortfall, to be financed by the company, that could run up an $800 million IOU by 2003. In the past, the Public Utilities Commission has allowed the utility to pass on such shortfalls to consumers in the form of higher rates. Pacific Gas&Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's other investor-owned utilities, have collectively lost at least $3.3 billion this summer because their retail rates have remain capped under deregulation. Both utilities are seeking to end their retail rate caps early to escape the risk of sustained high wholesale prices. Consumer groups are outraged; investors are skeptical. Three major credit rating companies said the California utilities face increased regulatory uncertainty, and the utilities' stock prices fell last week. A hot-potato mentality is emerging among policy-makers who say the authority to clamp down on market behavior has been dispersed by deregulation. California regulators and consumer advocates have great expectations for a series of state and federal investigations into the causes of higher prices and into charges of market manipulation and price gouging by power companies. Chief among them is an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that may lead to changes in California's power trading system. ""Unfortunately, we have ceded most of our authority over wholesale markets to the federal government,"" said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission, the state's top regulator. James Hoecker, the chairman of the federal commission, said Lynch overstates the case. ""California has not given me one scintilla of authority that I didn't already have,"" Hoecker said in August. The federal commission has been critical of California's approach to deregulation, but has been reluctant to intervene in interstate wholesale markets, into state trading systems, or to make aggressive use of its investigative powers. What is dawning on California policy-makers, analysts say, is the hard lesson that deregulation transfers considerable authority away from government officials and to the market participants. The challenge is to get deregulation right the first time. ""The problem is not deregulation,"" said Robert McCullough, an economist and former utility executive based in Portland, Ore. ""The problem is this Rube Goldberg device that has been constructed in California."" The trading practices of power marketers in the West also is under scrutiny by the federal commission. Regulators informed electricity marketing companies in August that if price gouging is found, the refund of some profits may be ordered by the commission for windfall profits that are earned after mid-October. A surprising number of observers say generators have simply acted in their own interest and taken advantage of the rules to make money. Ranging from consumer advocates to economists to some regulators themselves, many say bungled deregulation is a more likely cause of high prices than a conspiracy of generating companies. ""This market has behaved very rationally this summer,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist who chairs the market surveillance committee of California's power transmission manager. ""All you need is tight supply to exercise market power in this market; you don't need collusion."" A titanic shift is shaping up in the way power is bought on the wholesale markets on behalf of California consumers. All three utilities have been granted authority by state regulators to make confidential deals for electricity directly with individual generators or power trading companies, largely bypassing the state's nonprofit power exchange. In an equally important development, the manager of most of California's transmission system has asked federal regulators for permission to sign long-term deals for power. Up to now, the transmission manager has been limited to last-minute purchases of emergency power to stabilize the grid. Critics fear both measures are steps toward reinstating the system that existed before deregulation, in which a small number of buyers made large, long-term deals with a handful of suppliers. The architects of California's deregulation, fearing the monopoly power of the utilities, had stripped bilateral purchasing authority to foster competition among a new kind of retail power provider.

Bushnell and Frank A. Wolak Regulators of electricity markets around the world continue to struggle with the problem of incentivizing generators whose output, due to their location in the grid, has no viable substitutes. Such generators possess 'local' market power. Since these generators also compete in broader regional markets, the actions taken to exploit their local market power can also effect market outcomes over larger areas. In California, a contract structure known as the reliability must-run (RMR) contract was developed to address the problem of local market power. However, the contract form that was in place during 1998 created serious incentive problems. We find that, during the months of June through September 1998, RMR contracts had the effect of raising overall supply bid prices from most producers, thereby leading to higher energy prices in the California regional market.

(July 1999) PWP-069 by Catherine Wolfram Policy makers everywhere have analyzed and tried to learn from the UK electricity restructuring, adopting some of the same market features but modifying others. Now the British government has embarked on a radical reform of their electricity industry, called the Programme to Reform the Electricity Trading Arrangements or ""RETA."" The changes to the electricity market are slated for September 2000. Some of the changes will bring the UK in line with what other countries have done, but other changes will be unique. Is the UK poised to leapfrog the rest of the world, adopting every market feature that has proved successful and modifying those that have not? Should the rest of the world be following the UK's lead on some of these changes? This paper argues that the answer is a decisive ""no"" to both questions. While proposed reforms to introduce demand-side bidding and encourage financial innovation make sense, the government's proposal to pay suppliers their bids rather than the market clearing price will not help achieve the stated goals of fostering competition and lowering prices.

Knittel Many policy-makers are currently weighing the advantages of deregulating electricity markets over more traditional regulatory methods. However, within this traditional regulatory environment many options exist. In particular, the use of incentive regulation programs in US electricity markets has grown during the past two decades. These programs differ in both their goals and how they attempt to meet these goals. In this paper, I discuss the wide array of programs that have been utilized, and investigate the impact of individual programs on the technical efficiency of a large set of coal and natural gas generator units. Within a stochastic frontier framework, I allow the distribution of inefficient production to be a function of the regulatory environment the plant operates under. The results suggest that while certain incentive regulations increase observed technical efficiency, others have either no effect or even lead to a reduction in efficiency.

In this paper, I attempt to clarify the meaning of market power and show how it can be distinguished from competitive pricing in markets with significant short-run supply constraints. I also address two common myths about market power: (a) that it is present in all markets and (b) that it must be present in order for firms to remain profitable in markets with significant fixed costs. I conclude by arguing that, while a finding of market power in an industry does not necessarily indicate that government intervention is warranted, such analysis is an important part of creating sound public policy.

(August 1999) PWP-066 by Carl Blumstein California electricity consumers can choose a retail electricity service provider, but most have not done so. These consumers remain, by default, customers of the utility distribution companies (UDCs). Pricing electricity for these default customers is now an issue before the California Public Utilities Commission. In California this issue is framed largely in terms of two alternatives: pass through of the wholesale electricity price or a performance-based rate (PBR). Under the first alternative, purchase from the California Power Exchange (PX) would be mandatory; under the second, each UDC would determine where to purchase supply and each UDC's performance would be gauged by comparing its costs to the PX price. This paper identifies issues that should be addressed in choosing between the two alternatives. First the paper examines the effects of the two alternatives on electricity prices. The analysis suggests that, at least in the near term, the choice will not have much effect on prices. Next the paper looks at possible perverse incentives. A central concern here is that, if providing default service becomes profitable, UDCs might use their distribution assets to stifle competition in the retail market. Finally, the paper examines regulatory costs associated with the alternatives and concludes that regulatory costs are likely to be higher under a PBR.

Knittel Electricity and natural gas markets have traditionally been serviced by one of two market structures. In some markets, electricity and natural gas are sold by a dual-product regulated monopolist, while in other markets, electricity and natural gas are sold by separate single-product regulated monopolies. This paper analyzes the relative pricing and investment decisions of electricity firms operating in the two market structures. The unique relationship between these two products, namely that electricity and natural gas are substitutes in consumption and natural gas is an input into the generation of electricity, allows me to gain inferences regarding the efficacy of regulation in both the electricity and natural gas industries. The results imply that both electricity prices and reliance on natural gas generation are higher in a dual-product setting, both suggestive that regulators respond to the relative incentives of electricity and natural gas firms.

We examine the degree of competition in the California wholesale electricity market during June-November 1998 by comparing the market prices with estimates of the prices that would have resulted if all firms were price takers. We find that there were significant departures from competitive pricing and that it was most pronounced during the highest demand periods. Overall, this raised the cost of power purchases by about 22% above the competitive level. We also explain why the prices observed cannot be attributed to competitive peak-load pricing.

We consider the hypothesis that generators are better able to exercise market power when transmission constraints bind, resulting in smaller, more-concentrated markets. We test this hypothesis by comparing equilibrium prices across periods with different demand elasticity and with and without binding transmission constraints. We find some empirical evidence that prices in local markets are higher during constrained periods when demand is less elastic.

To the extent that transmission rights provide their owners with an added level of influence or control over transmission markets, some of the historical industry concerns over vertical market power may need to be revisited. In this paper, I discuss some of the potential concerns over transmission rights and their use for the exercise of various forms of market power. Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format: ""Power-Grid Decentralization"" (March 1999) PWP-061 by Bart McGuire Most of the literature concerned with decentralized operations in power grids has focussed on partitioning systems initially into two main parts, the transmission system and the market of users (the ""ISO"" and the ""PX""), and asking how the actions of these two subgroups can be properly coordinated. While a number of studies have gone on to examine decentralized operations in the user market of producers and consumers, little attention has been given to how the operation of the transmission system itself might be decentralized. In this paper we propose an organizational procedure for coordinating the actions of the managers of given subgrids of a larger system. Non-invasive price-quantity dialogs are defined that, under fairly general circumstances, bring about perfect short-run coordination of the aggregate grid.

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif. ( October 17, 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate ""power emergencies"" because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors emissions. ""We are seeing a lot of under-generation,"" McCullough said. ""This is market power in action."" Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies, including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. ""That can't possibly be right,"" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. ""In North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). ""Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, I can't comment,"" Lloyd said. ""We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,"" he said. ""We don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high."" Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states, British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. ""EPA data is notoriously unreliable,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. ""Greed would get the best of anybody,"" Wolak said. ""I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out."" Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading companies. ""If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,"" Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled ""proprietary"" by companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets. ""Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally?"" Belden said. ""California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody understands,"" he said. ""If you've got nothing to hide, release the data."" ----- To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com (c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee= ,=20 heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that quizzed the FERC=20 commissioners and Davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic Western=20 electricity market. ?????Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged=20 price-gouging by out-of-state generators. ?????""To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to=20 Californians,"" Davis said. ""It is unconscionable for the generators to prof= it=20 from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law= =20 and order the energy companies to give back the money."" ?????Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.=20 California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,=20 power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitiv= e=20 market would warrant, he said. ?????California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a seri= es=20 of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economi= c=20 slowdown since the power crisis began last year. ?????The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate= =20 whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or=20 exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators= =20 deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply=20 shortages. ?????Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded ""price mitigation""= =20 program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price=20 limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had= =20 previously applied only to California during emergency power outages. ?????Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a=20 legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,= =20 California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on= a=20 package of energy amendments, including a price cap. ?????The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,=20 contending they would discourage more power production. ?????Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that=20 supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not hel= p,=20 California. ?????The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts= =20 this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at= =20 $150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would= =20 shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on producti= on=20 costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of= =20 capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study. ?????However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some= =20 kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the=20 congressional elections next year. ?????The FERC plan expands an existing ""price mitigation"" program in=20 California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through Septemb= er=20 2002, means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power= =20 cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a Stage 1= =20 power shortage emergency in California. ?????A Stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7= =20 percent of demand on the Western power grid. ?????The plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into= =20 California as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the= =20 state's financially weak utilities. ?????Davis was due to meet the two newest FERC commissioners, Patrick Wood = of=20 Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, today.

Summer 2001, the blackout season, is only a day away. ?????Already Californians anticipate power outages when temperatures rise. = By=20 August, the occasional annoyances endured so far--stoplights gone dark,=20 computers, air conditioners and elevators idled--could seem almost quaint. ?????Gov. Gray Davis insists we needn't worry. Four large new power plants= =20 are firing up soon, he said, and government's best and brightest are lockin= g=20 up still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need. Californians,=20 Davis predicts, will valiantly heed his call to conserve, helping the state= =20 survive the hot months, no sweat. ?????With luck, he'll be right. Power prices have stabilized, and some ener= gy=20 analysts are wondering whether California may have tamed the blackout beast= . ?????But what if those plants don't get built in time, people don't trim=20 their electricity use 7% and energy imports are more meager than expected? ?????And what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot,= =20 as Davis bets, but blistering, record-setting hot? ?????Government experts who ponder such questions don't expect disaster in= =20 the coming months. But they are planning for it nonetheless. ?????At best, they say, Californians can expect some gridlocked=20 intersections, an occasionally overloaded 911 system, perhaps some business= =20 bankruptcies, certainly inconvenience. At worst, the Western power grid cou= ld=20 crash, causing uncontrolled blackouts that might lead to looting,=20 contaminated water supplies, even civil unrest. ?????""How bad could this summer get?"" said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana= ).=20 ""This summer could be the worst disaster to ever hit the state of Californi= a."" ?????Imagine it's a Thursday morning in the third week of July. Relentless= =20 heat grips California, the curse of a stubborn high-pressure ridge that jus= t=20 won't budge. ?????As air conditioners from Redding to Chula Vista lumber to life, manage= rs=20 of the state's power grid in Folsom gulp their third and fourth cups of=20 coffee, stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret. ?????Demand is jumping. Supply is static, Canada and Arizona have nothing t= o=20 sell. It's looking tight. ?????Thirty minutes later, the picture is gloomier. A brush fire shuts down= =20 transmission lines near Fresno, squeezing supply in the Central Valley. In= =20 the Bay Area, the unusual heat drives demand well past projections. ?????By noon things look bleak. Operators of the Diablo Canyon nuclear powe= r=20 plant near San Luis Obispo have cut output by 80%. The trouble? Chunks of= =20 kelp have lodged in one of the plant's seawater intake valves, creating a= =20 clog like one that plagued the facility in January. ?????With a chorus of groans, the grid's keepers scour the market for power= =20 to offset the Diablo loss. No luck. As the mercury climbs and the Golden=20 State economy roars into full swing, electricity consumption ticks upward,= =20 minute by minute. And when managers of a power plant near Long Beach cut=20 output because of a cracked turbine, everyone knows what it means. ?????Alert the utilities. It's lights out, California, for the fourth day i= n=20 a row. ?????Dr. J. Michael Leary dreads blackouts--not personally, but=20 professionally. Leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of= =20 Rancho Mirage. When air conditioners go on the blink there, the=20 victims--scores of them, mostly old folks--wind up in his ER. ?????In a normal year, 75% of his emergency patients are geriatrics. Like= =20 infants, the elderly are unusually vulnerable to the heat. When blackouts= =20 hit, they are most at risk. ?????""It's as if you lived in Maine and they turned the heat off in January= ,""=20 Leary said. ""This is an extreme environment we live in. The effects can be= =20 devastating."" ?????Many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes, som= e=20 of them poorly insulated boxes that turn into ovens under the brutal summer= =20 sun. Take away the air conditioning and the humans inside start baking, qui= ck. ?????For Leary, the specter of continual, back-to-back blackouts in=20 July--and, some predict, in June and August too--conjures images of an=20 82-year-old man, living alone in one of those mobile homes, taking medicati= on=20 for heart disease. The cardiovascular drugs plague the man with numerous si= de=20 effects; one inhibits his body's ability to cool itself. ?????When a person gets overheated, body temperature eventually rises=20 uncontrollably. Then comes a nasty spiral of effects, and pretty soon ""you = go=20 into shock,"" Leary said. ""Everything just shuts down."" ?????On average each year, 371 Americans die from heat-related causes, more= =20 than the number killed by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning and= =20 floods combined.

Leary and others at= =20 Eisenhower Medical Center will be waiting, armed with ice packs, cooled IVs= =20 and ventilators. ?????""I am very, very worried,"" the doctor said. ""I think we'll see a great= =20 toll in human suffering, even mortality."" ?????California's tomato processors are no less anxious. They wash, cook,= =20 peel, chop, mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from July = to=20 October--enough to account for half the world's supply. For them, a string = of=20 unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days. ?????The reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processing--a sterile= =20 system instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plant's precise=20 temperature is disturbed. ?????Once a batch of tomatoes is tainted, it must be thrown out--all 50,000= =20 pounds. The plant must then be sanitized, a painstaking process that takes= =20 about 36 hours. ?????""If you get hit by blackouts every third day for, say, two weeks, you'= re=20 starting, stopping, cleaning, restarting--it's a nightmare,"" said Jeff Boes= e,=20 president of the California League of Food Processors. ""You could lose thre= e=20 batches and be out $40 million before you knew what hit you."" ?????Meanwhile, farmers with still more truckloads of tomatoes line up=20 outside the plant, waiting to be paid for their crop: ""If we can't process= =20 them, the farmers have spent an entire season growing them for nothing,""=20 Boese said. ?????In Sonoma County, the object in peril is the chicken. Egg producers=20 equip their laying houses with fans and swamp coolers to keep the hens=20 comfortable. Power is also needed to run giant refrigerators filled with eg= gs. ?????""In a blackout, those hens can overheat in no time,"" said Rich Matteis= =20 of the Pacific Egg and Poultry Assn.

Small-scale egg producers=20 often have no backup power at all. ?????Hundreds of other California businesses could suffer if summer shapes = up=20 as bad as some predict. ?????The Valero Refining Co. of California, northeast of San Francisco,=20 produces 115,000 barrels of gasoline a day. Because restarting a refinery i= s=20 a complicated task, two or three blackouts close together could prompt=20 officials to shutter it until electricity supplies stabilize--costing=20 California about 10% of its gasoline supply. ?????At a Berkeley medical laboratory, doctors say power losses to their=20 freezers could destroy bone marrow needed to give young leukemia patients= =20 lifesaving transplants. The state's 400 dialysis centers, where patients=20 without kidney function go to have their blood cleansed every other day, ar= e=20 in the same fix. Few have backup generators, so when an outage hits,=20 technicians must crank the machines by hand. ?????Most Californians, of course, face far more ordinary consequences. The= =20 scoreboards will fizzle at summer softball games, joggers on treadmills wil= l=20 be stopped in their tracks, electric organs will go silent, leaving choirs = to=20 sing without accompaniment. ?????Parents will be asked to retrieve children from day-care centers when= =20 the lights and cooling systems conk out. Anniversary lunches may be ruined= =20 when restaurants cannot grill salmon or blend margaritas. ?????Most people will tolerate occasional disturbances, psychologists say,= =20 doing their part in a time of crisis. But what if such irritations become a= n=20 everyday fact of life? ?????Hundreds of ""essential"" energy users--including prisons, fire=20 departments and airports--are protected from blackouts, and hundreds more= =20 have applied for exemptions. That means the pool of people bearing the=20 blackout burden is shrinking, so more frequent outages are likely. ?????Blackout predictions vary widely, but at least one forecaster, a=20 consultant for California water districts, anticipates an outage almost eve= ry=20 afternoon of every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm. ?????Californians are accustomed to trash compactors, giant-screen TVs and= =20 having the Internet at their fingertips.

""But the civilized behavior only lasts = a=20 short period. Then people start acting in unpredictable ways."" ?????That tendency may be exacerbated, Butterworth said, by the nature of t= he=20 energy crisis--not a natural disaster, but a man-made one. ?????""People start to look for a scapegoat,"" he said. ""People will look for= a=20 target, and there's a tendency to strike out at whoever is closest to you."" ?????One place that tendency may surface, Butterworth said, is on=20 traffic-clogged roads. Blackouts already have led to scores of accidents.

But on top of the fire fears, he= =20 warns that blackouts of more than a few hours would allow air into water=20 pipes, contaminating supplies. If that happens, Californians would be urged= =20 to boil their water until the system can be disinfected from one end of the= =20 pipe to the other. ?????Though rolling blackouts are risky, they remain essentially a controll= ed=20 phenomenon, occurring when and where the grid managers and utilities decide= .=20 Far more frightening--and devastating--are unexpected, cascading outages th= at=20 could shut down the entire Western power grid.

Gray Davis. ?????As early as next week, the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the sta= te=20 budget by allowing Treasurer Phil Angelides to borrow $5 billion to buy=20 electricity. That money is expected to cover power purchases until this fal= l,=20 when the state plans to sell an unprecedented $12.5 billion in bonds to rep= ay=20 the general tax fund and buy future electricity. ?????Angelides said Tuesday that he has already lined up $3.5 billion in=20 loans from two Wall Street firms, and expects to secure at least another=20 billion by next week, when he plans to close the deal and obtain the money. ?????The loan is critical, he said, because without it, electricity purchas= es=20 would completely deplete state coffers as early as October. ?????""In essence, it stops the general-fund bleeding,"" Angelides said. ""Wha= t=20 this interim financing does is take the pressure off the general fund and,= =20 hopefully, avert a cash crisis."" ?????The loan could also ease concerns on Wall Street that California's ris= ky=20 entry into the power business has placed the state budget in a precarious= =20 position. Those concerns were one of the main reasons two major credit rati= ng=20 agencies downgraded the state earlier this year. ?????""We have been looking forward to this day,"" said Ray Murphy, a vice=20 president at Moody's Investors Service, one of the two firms that downgrade= d=20 California's credit rating.

Rather, it permits Angelides to use the loan proceeds to assist t= he=20 Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying power, with its futu= re=20 electricity expenses. ?????If the bond issue is further delayed, Angelides estimated, the loan=20 would gives California another four to six months before it would begin to= =20 run out of money. Furthermore, the loan closes a potential loophole that=20 existed in the long-term contracts Davis had signed to stabilize the cost o= f=20 electricity, which would have let power suppliers walk away from the deals = if=20 the state had not secured a source of financing by next month. ?????But Republicans warned that by entering into a bridge loan deal withou= t=20 knowing when the bonds would be sold, Davis and the Democrats were incurrin= g=20 major risks that could further drive up the price tag of the crisis. ?????The loan carries a blended interest rate of about 4.5%, but if it is n= ot=20 repaid by Oct. 31, the rate jumps to 7%.

As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale= =20 generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into=20 recession.=20 ?????The FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and= =20 natural gas shortages.=20 ?????Let's look at what the FERC did right. First, the order approved Monda= y=20 establishes price caps on a 24/7 basis rather than simply during power=20 emergencies--a long overdue reform.=20 ?????Second, the order protects the entire West, not just California. This= =20 regional cap will end ""megawatt laundering,"" whereby in-state generators so= ld=20 power across California lines and then resold it back into the state to eva= de=20 caps.=20 ?????Third, the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the= =20 FERC's previous price caps Swiss cheese. Before, generators could redirect= =20 their sales from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the pric= e=20 caps.=20 ?????So where did the FERC go wrong? The problem may be traced to the two= =20 competing methods of imposing price caps and the all-important concept of= =20 ""economic rent.""=20 ?????Economic rent, in the wholesale electricity market, is the market pric= e=20 of electricity minus the producer's cost, where cost includes not just labo= r=20 and fuel but a ""fair profit"" on the invested capital as well. In traditiona= l=20 regulation, this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost o= f=20 the money borrowed to build the power plant.=20 ?????Under this definition, if the producer's cost is a nickel a kilowatt= =20 hour and he can sell it for 35 cents--as producers in the West have been=20 doing--the producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers.= =20 ?????In California, the extraction of such economic rent through market=20 manipulation has taken place on a grand-theft scale. In 1999, California's= =20 electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it was almost $30 billion= =20 for roughly the same amount of electricity. This year, California's bill is= =20 well on its way to $50 billion annually.=20 ?????To stop this rip-off, Gov. Gray Davis proposed ""cost-based"" price caps= .=20 Such caps are calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allow= ed=20 to recover its cost of production, including the fair profit, but not a pen= ny=20 more.=20 ?????Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at= a=20 nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel. The oldest, least efficien= t=20 plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cent= s.=20 ?????By setting different prices for different plants, the economic rents a= re=20 driven to zero. Yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to=20 produce. From a public policy perspective, it's the best of all possible=20 worlds. And it was categorically rejected by the FERC. Instead, the FERC se= ts=20 a single price for all generators based on the cost of the ""least efficient= =20 plant.""=20 ?????The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still= =20 allows generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers.=20 ?????In our previous example, and under the FERC's rule, the least efficien= t=20 plant still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs. However, the most=20 efficient plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt also collects 20= =20 cents rather than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic=20 rent.=20 ?????Thus, under the FERC's rule, wholesale generators still will be able t= o=20 capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than= =20 under Davis' cost-based rule.=20 ?????The FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic=20 gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure th= at=20 during peak times, when the price cap is being established, the most=20 expensive possible plant is in operation--whether it needs to be or not. Th= is=20 will peg the price at the highest level.=20 ?????In addition, the FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to= =20 run their least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient=20 plants are also the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air.=20 Moreover, the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on=20 already stretched natural gas supplies.

California is the dog.""=20 To understand why the Northwest is now facing its own energy crisis and how= =20 the energy problems in the Northwest and California each affect each other,= =20 one must understand how the Northwest gets its power.=20 In the Northwest, falling water is our primary fuel. Depending on the=20 available snowpack, hydroelectricity produced at more than 200 dams in the= =20 Columbia River basin generates between 60 and 75 percent of the region's=20 electricity. About two-thirds of this hydropower comes from 29 dams owned a= nd=20 operated by the two federal agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and= =20 the Bureau of Reclamation.=20 By taking advantage of the region's geography and climate, the Columbia's= =20 hydroelectric dams have produced some of the least expensive electricity in= =20 the nation, power that has been the economic backbone of the region.=20 However, the Columbia's hydrosystem also has two curses.=20 One is that water conditions can vary greatly, and right now the Northwest= =20 and California are in the middle of an extreme drought. The second is the= =20 dams' negative impact on salmon. These dams operate under a federal salmon= =20 recovery plan established under the Endangered Species Act that calls for= =20 more water to be sent over spillways to help push the salmon downstream=20 instead of through the dams' power-generating turbines.=20 That power is sold at cost and transmitted to Northwest consumer-owned=20 utilities by yet another federal agency called the Bonneville Power=20 Administration. These ""cost-based"" rates cover the expense of repaying the= =20 U.S.=20 Treasury for the cost of developing these hydropower projects, moving the= =20 power over massive transmission lines, and supporting efforts to restore th= e=20 dwindling salmon runs.=20 Under federal law, Northwest consumers get preferred access to the relative= ly=20 low-cost power. Any surplus power can be sold, most often to California's= =20 municipal and investor-owned utilities.=20 This Northwest ""regional preference"" to federal power was part of the deal= =20 that led to the construction of the massive transmission lines, called ""the= =20 intertie,"" which first connected the Northwest with California and the=20 Southwest in the late 1960s.=20 For decades, the intertie worked almost flawlessly and to everyone's benefi= t.=20 During the summer, when air conditioners caused California's power use to= =20 peak, many California utilities would supplement their needs by turning to= =20 the Northwest. In the winter, when Northwest electric furnaces are turned o= n=20 for space heating, California utilities would return the favor and ship the= ir=20 surplus power north.=20 Recently, the BPA has had to purchase large blocs of power on the wholesale= =20 market to meet its contractual obligations to its Northwest customers.=20 The same exorbitant wholesale prices that began to plague California last= =20 year have also affected the Northwest, meaning that the BPA has been runnin= g=20 out of money, and is now in danger of defaulting on its debt obligations to= =20 the Treasury.=20 California's deregulation plan has affected energy relations between the tw= o=20 regions in other ways. For example, the BPA has historically sold surplus= =20 power to California for relatively low prices.

California officials= =20 have praised the BPA for its cooperation, but Northwest environmentalists a= nd=20 tribal leaders complain that the BPA has been helping California address it= s=20 energy crisis by selling salmon down the river.=20 The Northwest will be helped by FERC's decision yesterday to extend limited= =20 temporary price restrictions it had imposed in California in the spring to= =20 other Western states during severe shortages. The order should also be good= =20 for California. Without consistent price restrictions throughout the West,= =20 power marketers would simply skip California during an emergency and sell a= t=20 higher prices elsewhere.=20 But not everyone is happy with the decision.

This is a case where= =20 the third time is unlikely to be a charm.=20 As chairman of the Market Surveillance Committee of the California=20 Independent System Operator, the independent committee formed by FERC to=20 monitor the California market, I have analyzed the results of FERC's previo= us=20 attempts. They reveal a misunderstanding of important details of the=20 California electricity market. It is therefore not surprising that they hav= e=20 been ineffective.=20 Starting in November of 2000, FERC acknowledged that wholesale prices in=20 California during the summer of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable. Its=20 December 2000 order implemented the first set of remedies. Both the=20 California Power Exchange Market Monitoring Committee and the committee I= =20 chair pointed out important shortcomings in FERC's analysis of the Californ= ia=20 market and argued that its remedies would most likely harm, rather than=20 enhance, market performance.=20 At this time, FERC also did not order refunds for the unjust and unreasonab= le=20 prices, even though it acknowledged the prices reflected the exercise of=20 market power, which is the ability of a producer to force prices higher. Th= e=20 Federal Power Act requires refunds under these circumstances. But FERC said= =20 it was unable to find specific instances of firms exercising market power.= =20 This makes no sense. If FERC finds that prices indicate market power, then= =20 the generators who bid those prices are exercising market power.=20 Following the implementation of these remedies, conditions in the Californi= a=20 market deteriorated far beyond what had been predicted by the two market=20 monitoring committees. Even though January and February are the lowest dema= nd=20 months of the year, average wholesale electricity prices were almost 10 tim= es=20 higher in 2001 than they were during the same two months of 2000 and almost= =20 double the average price during the summer of 2000. In January, March and= =20 May, California experienced several days of rolling blackouts and had syste= m=20 emergencies almost every day during January and February of 2001.=20 IN April, FERC made another round of market rule changes designed to lead t= o=20 just and reasonable prices. However, in response to growing pressure from= =20 Congress, less than 10 days after these remedies were implemented, FERC=20 enacted its most recent order.=20 Before Congress declares victory, it should verify that FERC's most recent= =20 plan achieves the following two goals.=20 First, the plan should guarantee that the average price of wholesale=20 electricity paid by California over the next two years is equal to the=20 average price that would occur in a competitive electricity market, with=20 California's current supply and demand conditions and fuel costs. The Feder= al=20 Power Act requires not just a high probability of just and reasonable rates= ;=20 it requires that they occur with certainty.=20 The second goal is to alter the incentives faced by all market participants= =20 so that it will no longer be profit-maximizing for a firm to withhold=20 electricity from the market in order to drive up prices.=20 FERC's most recently implemented plan does not achieve either of these goal= s,=20 although it does come closer than any previous attempts.=20 One solution satisfying both of these goals has been proposed to FERC. In a= =20 December report to FERC, the Market Surveillance Committee of the Californi= a=20 ISO proposed a one-time regulatory intervention. This intervention would=20 require that each generator serving California sign a forward contract=20 guaranteeing that California consumers can purchase 75 percent of the=20 generator's expected output over the next two years at a specified=20 competitive benchmark price. Once a firm has signed these forward contracts= ,=20 it is free to sell all remaining energy in the western U.S. wholesale marke= t=20 at whatever price it can obtain.=20 The obligation to provide power under the contracts, and the incentive to= =20 sell 25 percent of power at unrestricted prices, would prevent generators= =20 from withholding power.=20 Unless FERC implements a solution satisfying these two goals, Congress shou= ld=20 require FERC to suspend the market-based pricing authority for all supplier= s=20 in the Western U.S. for the next two years and order all sales during this= =20 period at cost-of-service prices. This will guarantee that FERC meets the= =20 statutory mandate of the Federal Power Act in California. Frank Wolak is a professor of economics at Stanford University.=20 Wednesday, June 20, 2001=20 Easing the crunch on costs of power=20 It could have been worse. Yesterday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio= n=20 expanded limited price caps on electricity to cover 11 Western states and t= o=20 last 24 hours a day during an emergency.=20 This follows an action in April that imposed caps only in California during= =20 the hours the state declared a power emergency.=20 Under the new rules, ""when reserves are below 7 percent in the California= =20 Independent System Operator spot markets ... the maximum price that can be= =20 charged for spot market sales ... will be 85 percent of the highest hourly= =20 price that was in effect during the most recent Stage 1 [emergency] called = by=20 the ISO,"" the FERC explained yesterday. The order will last until Sept. 30, 2001.=20 The action came after intense pressure by Democrats and the Bush=20 administration on the FERC, whose three Republican and two Democrat members= =20 all voted for the new controls. It also comes after continuing stories about ""gouging"" by suppliers. On=20 Sunday, the Register reported how Tulsa-based Williams, an energy supplier,= =20 manipulated the market to keep prices high.=20 And after Gov.

The new FERC ruling certainly is better than the demand for across-the-boar= d,=20 continuous price controls demanded by Gov. Davis and other Democrats.

''The president took that on=20 board.''=20 Similarly, the steel decision was partly about enforcing laws against=20 ''dumping'' foreign products in the market -- and partly about Mr. Bush's= =20 desire to convince labor unions not to block his trade agenda. Like=20 Californians coping with higher energy prices, the steelworkers need time t= o=20 adjust to a new world, the administration said.=20 ''Open markets improve the lives of people by increasing opportunity, choic= e=20 and economic freedom,'' Robert B.

''But compassionate conservatism also recognize= s=20 the reality that the effects of rapid change fall harder on some communitie= s=20 and industries,'' which, he said, need ''vital breathing space to adapt to= =20 change.''=20 While Mr. Bush expressed deep reservations about I.M.F. bailouts during the= =20 presidential campaign, the situation seemed a bit more complicated once he= =20 got to Washington. The State and Defense Departments feared that if Turkey= =20 were engulfed in economic chaos, and blamed the United States for failing t= o=20 come to its aid, its leaders might be less inclined to let American fighter= =20 jets use its territory to mount missions over Iraq.=20 So given the choice between letting the Turkish people pay a high price for= =20 political mistakes -- Californians take note -- and weakening American=20 pressure on Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush decided that economic niceties were le= ss=20 important than political consistency.

However, Hildebrandt cannot say who the supplier is unless DWR, CAISO, or the PX was the buyer (for those buyers he presumably has detailed data). Thus, he can ascribe overcharges to specific jurisdictional generators for only $5.4 billion of the $9billion total. He does not show what specific parties are attrributable to the $5.4 billion. In an earlier study on just ISO R/T ""strategic bidding"", supplier names were released inadvertantly by CAISO.

As I understand it, there are two aspects of this: 1. The offer of Enron and others last year to sell power to California utilities for 5 cents per kw. Failure to accept these offers resulted in higher power costs in the range of $15 billion, as I recall from yesterday's call. 2. The long term contracts that California signed this year after taking actions and making statements that drove up the forward price curves are now under water to the tune of $20 billion. On both counts we will be pressed for assumptions and documentation to pursue these arguments, which parallel the comments made by senior management in Capitol Hill meeting last week. We will work on back up on this end, but we would greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard as well. With Congress out of session starting COB on Thursday, we will need information pulled together by tomorrow COB to get the final product in the hands of congressional types and others who can use it on a timely basis.

At this point, we may be able to just say it is based on a comparison of the contracts with today's forward market and gloss over the exact forward curve we used. Of course if there is a way to come up with a similar number using publicly available data (or if we are willing to provide our numbers if pressed) then all the better. In the mean time, should I hold off on using the $13.8 billion number until I hear back from you about the conversation with Steve? Also, do I understand correctly from Alan that the $13.8 billion figure is NOT comparing the long term contracts California signed with recent spot market prices, but rather is a comparison of the contracts to our present forward pricing curves? From you e-mail, it is the latter, I take it. As to point #1, on the deal last year, we just need a similar ""back of the envelope"" calculation on what California could have saved had California taken us up on the offers we and others made. Any guidance on where to get that would be most helpful.",important

By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld production to drive up prices. But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator. Richard J. Connors, an auxiliary operator, and E. Robert Edwards, an electrician, said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle during emergency periods for no apparent reason. Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator -- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and varied its production. While that testimony drew significant attention, it was countered Monday by a report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18. On Thursday, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in its defense. ""The ISO could have dispatched those units at will,"" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams, referring to unused equipment. But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has filed a lawsuit against generators, contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding history. ""These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production,"" Bustamante said. Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in Chula Vista. For most of that time, the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two years ago, Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under state-mandated agreements that ended in April. Edwards said that during power blackouts in January, he saw a 225-megawatt unit off-line. Other units, he said, were operating far below capacity. ""Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money,"" Edwards said. Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those ""who did not have the complete picture."" ""It's dead on, dead true that there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity and there is a Stage 3,"" Williams said. ""There may be blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck)."" Bustamante, however, maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the market, calling Connors and Edwards the ""tip of the iceberg"" in the price-gouging investigation. State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate committee investigating price manipulation, said Connors and Edwards may testify before lawmakers after further evaluation. Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify, he said. The Bee's Kevin Yamamura can be reached at (916) 326-5542 or kyamamura@sacbee.com. Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers By Ed Fletcher Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp. from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. ""SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,"" Lockyer said in a prepared statement. Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. have been made before, responded Greg Pruett, a vice president of PG&E Corp. ""That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public Utilities Commission earlier this year, by an Assembly oversight committee, and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co.,"" Pruett said. In its filing with the SEC, the attorney general's office said that ""without meaningful review by the SEC, it cannot be determined what impact the transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt utility."" An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition. Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than $4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co. The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants, as was required by deregulation. ""The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build those plants,"" Pruett said. The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends, he said. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up $6.6 billion in debt. The Bee's Ed Fletcher can be reached at (916) 326-5548 or efletcher@sacbee.com. Business; Financial Desk California State Seeks SEC Probe of PG&E Transfers NANCY RIVERA BROOKS ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its responsibilities as a utility holding company. At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated sister companies of the utilities. The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing, said PG&E Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett. The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding companies and their utility subsidiaries. Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption, citing $13 billion in PG&E assets outside of California . ""All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp.,"" Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated. In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, PG&E said it is close to reaching an agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of relatively cheap electricity . In all, PG&E buys about 2,600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25 alternative generators, which are seeking repayment and release from their contracts through Bankruptcy Court. National Desk THE NATION Little Progress on Energy Rebate, Judge Hints RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A-30 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble, and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be fading. Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if he sees no progress. ""The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,"" said Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for FERC. ""He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit."" Originally, a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan. Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed, the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. Kit Konolige, a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York, said Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal. ""The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a settlement,"" said Konolige. ""I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things, but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement."" Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants, several people with knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks began last week. They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with several large power suppliers. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers are insisting they do not owe anything. Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's jurisdiction. On the other hand, it seems clear from statements by FERC commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from generators. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and $9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds, guarantees that generators will be paid, and ways to shift more of the state's power purchases to long-term contracts. The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement. Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today, he will give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report might embarrass some of the key players, since Wagner is known for his plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement recommendation for the FERC board by July 16. However, he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a settlement if it appears within striking distance. The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating. Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move. ""It was like a shot across the bow,"" said one source. * RELATED STORIES Energy savers: College students help businesses cut waste. B1 SEC probe: The state urges a review of PG&E fund transfers.

C2 Davis energy team denied pay State controller says work for Edison is a conflict of interest Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N198197.DTL Sacramento -- State Controller Kathleen Connell is refusing to pay two former Clinton- Gore campaign operatives hired by Gov. Gray Davis, even though one of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid conflict-of- interest allegations. Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the ""Masters of Disaster"" for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 presidential campaign. Because of their work for Davis, Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility. Late last week, at the bottom of a press release, Davis announced that Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been ""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand, has dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses, which he didn't have before, and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001. In his release, Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former communications director Phil Trounstine, about $9,900 a month. But Connell, like Davis a Democrat, said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours in a month for his $9,990. ""We don't intend to be paying it,"" Connell said of the contract for both men. ""They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict."" Previously, the Davis administration said there was no conflict because Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier this week, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules. Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been working full-time on public policy, even though his contract caps his salary. The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly monitors legislation, sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract. In a recently filed disclosure statement, Fabiani also listed more than $10, 000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems, another company that frequently brings issues before state authorities, including Davis. The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane violated state ethics rules.

Page?A - 3 Ex-staff speaks out against Duke Two more charge prices manipulated Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N122949.DTL Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated the energy market to drive up prices, although they offered no hard proof and little new information. Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they observed suspicious behavior, including the disappearance of parts needed for repairs, the idling of generators for no apparent reason, and continual stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold power and artificially increase prices. E. Robert Edwards, a 50-year-old electrician, related one conversation with a Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion. ""I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running,"" Edwards said yesterday at a press conference. ""We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to that information.' "" State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during three days in January, when the company at one point offered a single megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3,880. Duke says it was following orders from the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid, when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days. An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation, since Duke has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid during that period. The two workers who came forward yesterday, Edwards and 46-year-old Richard J. Connors, both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April, two years after Duke purchased it from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation. SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR ""It is true units were taken offline, mostly on the weekends for whatever reason,"" said Connors, a former auxiliary operator. ""It got to the point as an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around putting units back online."" Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that are used to repair broken generators, although he didn't know where the parts went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power supply and push prices higher, lawmakers and other investigators suspect. Edwards, however, admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved. Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative committees, a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer, the California Public Utilities Commission and federal regulators. BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday, also is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors ""reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant."" Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke, said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday. Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the three days in January, Williams said state air regulations required the company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out. Duke, which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market, also contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase in load. ""Yes, it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity, and there is a Stage Three (alert), and there may be blackouts in San Francisco,"" Williams said. ""The reason why it's not running is the power cannot move up Path 15,"" the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation to take such an approach. ""This is going to be a showplace,"" said Scott Sossen, the chief executive officer of Edge Capital Group, a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada. The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E. ""It couldn't be more timely,"" said Mayor Tony Intintoli. Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to build new wind, solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one- megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days. Conservation is also part of the plan, and energy-efficiency improvements are already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations. City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by the end of the year. The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week. Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance, because Edge will finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs. In return, a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared with the Edge and O'Hara. ""This is a fairly sizable project,"" said Kevin Chambers, the chief executive officer at O'Hara. ""Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it is such a new field."" O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of new wind, solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen. In recent years, the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire departments, City Hall and water-pumping stations. Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas, keeping prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30. As a result, the city expects its energy bill to double next year, from 9.2 cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. ""It's been very positive what we've been doing, and it hasn't cost us anything,"" said City Manager David Martinez. ""We're going to be very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city."" City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4,500 businesses and 37,000 households.

Page?A - 23 SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp. violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt subsidiary. ``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,'' Lockyer said in a statement. More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999, according to Lockyer's petition, representing nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock, $1.5 billion to pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other subsidiaries, according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington. Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January. By moving assets from the utility to other businesses, the company potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility Holding Company Act in several ways, according to the petition. The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements, saying the company is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt. The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp., with more than $13 billion of its assets outside the state, can no longer claim it is primarily an intrastate company. The SEC should step in, it argues. The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials, who said they had no idea the attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the federal law, said company spokesman Greg Pruett. Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in several states: electric transmission and distribution, gas distribution or utility-owned generation. ``We have none of those things except in California,'' Pruett said, adding that the National Energy Group, a PG&E Corp. affiliate, ``has natural gas transmission but no distribution.'' ``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and thus aren't regulated by PUCHA, and it has an energy-trading arm that is also not regulated by PUCHA,'' he said. The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations. The petition states it expects a response from the SEC within 60 days. But SEC spokesman John Heine said there's no statutory deadline for a response. He said he had not seen the petition and could not comment. Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. Judge may speed up electricity refund talks Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR Los Angeles Times WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble. Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if progress is not made. ``The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,'' said Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman. ``He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit.'' Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by the deadline of Monday at midnight. If that failed, the judge said, he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the generators have offered less than $1 billion. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure that could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JOE COSTELLO BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis,'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the education governor. However, Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have revealed alarming failures, setting back state energy policy not one or two years, but one or two decades. While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels, disproportionate building of centralized generation plants, too little energy efficiency, lowering environmental standards and increased global warming emissions, Davis enacted it. First, Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second, he has encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil fuel plants. Finally, he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities. The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable generation. David Freeman, the governor's energy czar, giving lip service to alternatives, has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with fossil fuel generators. By comparison, the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly from the sun's energy, offering a clean, efficient solution to the state's future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy efficiency, the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the funding for supply. Most egregious, the vast majority of state energy efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities. While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals, in California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy. The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources, unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater degree to fossil fuels. After binding the state economy to the past, the Davis end game is logical. Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy fiasco. There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation. Instead of bailing out the utilities, they should be dismantled and sold off. A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on direct access to alternative suppliers. Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development, the education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to repeat its energy lessons.

Business Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political support Robert Gibbons, BridgeNews ? 07/06/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N Page 3 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune) Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible. The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region. The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 billion in 2001. With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled utilities. The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California . ""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California . ""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're proposing,"" Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position supporting some limited, short-term price mitigation. What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power authority to build state-owned plants. Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. http://www.washingtonpost.com Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com Politics & Policy U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact To End California Power-Overcharge Case By Richard B. Schmitt ? 07/06/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page A10 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still ""optimistic"" California officials and several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own ""preliminary assessment"" and recommendation as soon as today. In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the overcharge dispute. Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and recommendations within a week. At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own liking. The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies ""pirates"" and ""marauders."" The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation effort.",important

 'Megawatt Laundering'","""Ronald Carroll"" <rcarroll@bracepatt.com>",dasovich-j,"California Officials Investigate Electric 'Megawatt Laundering' Steve Johnson , San Jose Mercury News, Calif. ( October 31, 2000 ) Oct. 30--While investigating this summer's stunning spike in electricity prices, state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon: On days when the weather is hot, batches of power generated in California are sold to other states. A little later in the day, similar amounts of power are sold back to California -- but at much higher prices. The question is, is it the same power? If so, that could be ""megawatt laundering"" -- a multi-company conspiracy to evade California's wholesale price cap, which covers power generated in California but not power sold into California from elsewhere. Worried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of dollars, several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering during a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San Diego. And earlier this month, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-La Mesa -- who helped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California -- formally asked the commission to investigate the practice, which he termed ""potentially illegal market coordination."" But an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had concluded that generators had not abused the market. And others say concerns about megawatt laundering are exaggerated. Among them is Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, a power-firm trade group, and chairman of the Independent System Operator, which oversees most of California's power grid. While acknowledging that such laundering is possible, Smutny-Jones said there is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread. ""This is one of those things that's turning into an urban legend,"" he said. ""I don't want to characterize this as a significant problem."" Even some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that most of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing more sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a good deal when they see one. Nonetheless, they see evidence that at least some California-produced power is being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price. And they blame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed because the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power. The Independent System Operator ""invites this type of activity,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist who chairs the non-profit corporation's market surveillance committee, which has warned of the potential for megawatt laundering in at least two reports this year. ""The thing that makes all these problems go is the fact that the ISO has said, `We'll pay whatever it takes to keep the lights on,' and that's screwing consumers big time."" In 1998, when the state's energy markets were deregulated, it was generally assumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make power less expensive. As a precaution, however, officials at the Independent System Operator instituted wholesale price caps, which they lowered twice this summer to help keep a lid on costs. On July 1 this year, they reduced the cap from $750 per megawatt per hour to $500, one megawatt being sufficient power for 1,000 homes. Then, on Aug. 7, they cut it to $250. Unfortunately, things haven't worked out the way officials had hoped. Wholesale prices rose dramatically this year. And while a freeze on retail utility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers from those soaring costs, home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego, where a similar freeze already has come off. In the process, some generators learned that all it takes to get around the state's wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market works. One of the best ways to get top dollar, they learned, was to hold off selling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what is known as an out-of-market call for energy, which amounts to an emergency request for electricity. From May through September this year, the overall price of power in the state averaged less than $125 per megawatt hour, according to authorities. But over the same period, power sold in response to out-of-market calls averaged more than $430. During the summer, when energy use is at a maximum, California typically imports about one-fourth of the power it uses from other states. Since power generated by firms in other states isn't limited by California's price cap, those companies generally are in a better position than California firms to make a killing on out-of-market sales. But by cutting a deal with a collaborator in another state, energy specialists say, California generators also can profit handsomely -- despite the cap. Here's how: Say a California generator has 100 megawatts. Instead of selling it in California, where the firm can receive no more than $250 per megawatt hour under the current cap, it finds a utility, an electricity broker or a corporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state, such as Arizona. Then -- just before an expected heat wave in California, which is likely to result in an out-of-market call for power here -- it convinces the other firm to do a trade. Under the deal, the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour to the company in Arizona, where there is no price cap, and earns $300 or more per megawatt -- for a total of $300,000. In return, the Arizona firm ships its 100 megawatts for one hour here. Since that power isn't subject to California's cap, it earns perhaps $400 per megawatt -- for a total of $400,000. Presumably, energy specialists say, the two firms then split the $100,000 difference. The potential profit from such deals is considerable. Generators in and out of California received more than $110 million from out-of-market sales this summer, according to the Independent System Operator. But determining if megawatt laundering is really happening, how often and who might be benefiting, is difficult. One California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of power was being sold to another state and then sold back into California minutes later. But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that clear. While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any given day, they said, the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation. One big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been abused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these electricity transactions private. ""Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of this laundering don't necessarily have the documents"" to prove it, said Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, one of the state's three main utilities. ""We can only speculate based on things we've heard from others about the practice....It's our hope that's one of the things that's being examined"" by the various federal and state agencies investigating this summer's extraordinary rise in California power prices. Indeed, while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially limited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for out-of-state power, others argue that it's just as important to eliminate the secrecy surrounding electricity transactions. ""I'd like to see more information"" made public, said Jim Bushnell, a researcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley, who specializes in analyzing the state's energy markets. ""There are a lot of rumors circulating around this,"" he said of megawatt laundering, ""and it would help clarify if this is a serious problem."" ----- To see more of the San Jose Mercury News, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sjmercury.com",important

TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER July 11 2001 SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a= =20 ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and= =20 denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20 prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges. Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20 committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not= =20 creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6. But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July = 5=20 and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor= ts=20 left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would= =20 reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds. The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving= =20 PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission. State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian= s=20 by energy companies since last year. The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and= =20 customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b= y=20 a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said. The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee= =20 Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20 PG&E's 5.5 million customers. He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20 erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites. Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20 consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11= =20 reorganization. But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20 bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to= =20 participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

But if you listened=20 carefully, he also indicated he'll give them more time to consider the case= .=20 Considering the iffy odds of winning in court, we suggest he keep goading t= he=20 federal commissioners -- while giving them all the time they need. Wednesday, July 11, 2001=20 Lights go out on Davis' power show=20 Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20 applied to California's electricity crisis:=20 First, ""The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed= =20 maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9= =20 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis,"" reported the Register yesterday. Even= =20 that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes= =20 the power producers.=20 To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20 electricity crisis. Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state= =20 of California.=20 Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant= =20 the ""refunds,"" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could = be=20 stuck for years. ""In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20 future even in California, but not thanks to the state,"" Robert Michaels, a= =20 professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t= he=20 state's botched 1996 ""deregulation"" effort, which has been made worse by Go= v.=20 Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago. ""FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica= l=20 reality,"" Mr. Michaels added. ""Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'= t=20 owe $9 billion to California."" As this process continues, he said, another= =20 positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. ""We'll see what= =20 has been happening in the markets"" in which power is bought and sold. Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not ""Made in= =20 Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav= e=20 been contending.=20 In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring ""the greed of thes= e=20 Texas energy companies,"" such as Reliant and Dynergy. In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20 finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20 producers.=20 ""In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2= =20 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20 electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd= ro=20 in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel= es=20 Department of Water and Power,"" reported the San Jose Mercury News. Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20 companies with headquarters in Texas. Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be= =20 done next:=20 lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20 This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th= e=20 electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai= d=20 by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.= =20 Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin= g=20 in time to lower prices. lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20 off-peak hours.=20 lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20 Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before=20 ""deregulation.""

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of the bill"" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting. That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short, little has changed since yesterday. Best, Jeff",important

Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. Assembly leaders, who convened the group, set an ambitious schedule that would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. But the newly formed plan, which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions, remains too rough for a vote, said Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly ""on call"" for the scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal comes in the next three weeks. But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to travel throughout the state and beyond. Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not authorize a plan by then. His spokesman, Steven Maviglio, said Thursday the governor is not ruling out that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative discussions. ""It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus, but they're just not there,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor is optimistic about the Aug. 15 date."" Even so, Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until lawmakers return Aug. 20.

Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July 27, 2001 Sempra Energy, the parent company of SDG&E, reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a long-term contract to California. On the other hand, Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit, a middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others. The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets. The surprising announcement -- that a company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power. Stephen Baum, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra, said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal. California sought long-term electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and near-term power markets, where prices reached record levels. Critics say Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years. The governor has acknowledged that long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years, but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million. SDG&E says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers. In a media conference last month, Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers, who he said might have faced the so-called balancing account debt as early as next year. Shames says the proposal, which took the form of a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra. He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer ""makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers."" Shames said he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August. A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline, the Sempra spokesman, said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June. Sempra Energy Trading, meanwhile, said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region, which includes California. The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable period last year. California's Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid, and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis. Though Sempra earned money on trading, its wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed. Sempra Energy Resources, which co-owns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy, earned $2 million during the second quarter last year. Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- under which it will provide up to 1,900 megawatts -- has allowed its wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant, which will be expanded, and three generating facilities it expects to build. Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million during the quarter ended June 30, down from $40 million last year, according to Sempra. SDG&E, whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity, said it provided increased customer service during the crisis, which lowered profits. Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's results, noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003. ""They're really two years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses,"" said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. Bud Leedom, a San Diego-based analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper, said Sempra's move into energy trading now seems shrewd. ""We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this,"" Leedom said. Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday, to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange. Bloomberg news service contributed to this report. Smog Rules May Be Eased Power plants: EPA proposes a sweeping change in how utilities' emissions are curbed, a flexible approach favored by the industry. By GARY POLAKOVIC and ELIZABETH SHOGREN Times Staff Writers July 27 2001 WASHINGTON -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman proposed sweeping changes Thursday in the regulation of power plant pollution that would replace five of the government's toughest programs with a single, flexible approach favored by utilities. Whitman outlined a plan for cleaning up major components of power plant smog that represents a significant departure from the EPA's traditional regulatory dictums. She called for a major expansion of pollution credit trading, which, up to now, has had varying success. Under the new plan, the EPA would scrap some of the most stringent measures devised by the agency to deal with power plant emissions. One provision to be set aside aims to cut harmful mercury emissions; another is meant to reduce emissions from Midwestern power plants by 85%; another is designed to restore visibility at national parks. Especially unpopular with industry, one measure, known as new source review, requires the installation of advanced pollution controls whenever power plants are expanded or modified. It too would be phased out. ""New source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would no longer be necessary,"" Whitman told Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""All of those [programs] could be aligned into one regulatory process"" that she said would work better than existing rules. Whitman's comments offer the first peek into the administration's plans for cleaning some of the dirtiest polluters left in the nation. Debate over the administration's clean-air approach has shifted to Congress as it considers whether to revise the national Clean Air Act. The magnitude of the proposed revisions caught environmentalists by surprise but buoyed industry representatives who say existing controls are costly and inefficient. ""She has raised an appalling prospect of junking virtually every rule and strategy to deal with emissions of electric companies in return for some vague industry-sought plan for an emissions trading scheme,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental advocacy group. ""If they go forward with this, it means a wholesale fight over the Clean Air Act in Congress."" After the hearing, Whitman stressed that the overall goal is to clean the air more efficiently than current rules do. Although the administration has not yet released a so-called multipollutant cleanup strategy, Whitman contended that collapsing several regulations into one far-reaching approach would be easier for regulators and industry to manage. ""What we're looking for is targets under this legislation that significantly clean up the air beyond what our current regulatory, statutory requirements would do,"" Whitman said. She added that new source review, for example, ""could potentially be no longer necessary if you have the right kind of targets set in a multi-emissions bill. We have to wait and see where the targets are set."" Utilities have lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to prevent the EPA from aggressively enforcing the new source review regulation. Industry and administration officials say the provision is onerous and prevents plant upgrades, although EPA officials say it is a key tool for forcing dirty, old plants to cut emissions by up to 95%. During the Clinton administration, federal officials charged that 32 coal-fired power plants in several Southern and Midwestern states ignored a requirement that companies install advanced emission controls when their plants were upgraded. The government reached settlement with three utilities, but a provision in the Bush administration's energy plan stalled those enforcement actions pending a review of power plant controls. C. Boyden Gray, attorney for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council and former White House counsel for the first President Bush in the 1980s, praised the administration's proposal. He said major utility companies he represents, including Southern Co., Duke Energy Co. and the Tennessee Valley Authority, could clean up with greater flexibility and less cost under the plan outlined by Whitman. ""To put everything in a market-incentives basis is a great step. It would be a real breakthrough and a plus for the business community,"" Gray said. For example, Gray said EPA has four separate measures to control nitrogen oxides from power plant combustion, including programs to cut acid rain, ozone and haze. Another program scheduled to take effect in May 2004 requires power plants in 19 states to cut summer emissions by 1 million tons annually. He said those programs can be confusing and costly and could easily be replaced by a credit-trading program run largely by power companies. Under the program being considered by the Bush administration, an emission limit could be established at hundreds of power plants followed by annual reductions in mercury, a toxic metal, as well as smog-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides. However, a provision to reduce carbon dioxide, a gas implicated in global warming, was dropped under industry pressure. Power companies that reduce beyond their limits could sell emission credits, which represent a pound of pollution, to companies that exceed their limits. Although industry and free-market advocates favor such programs, they are not without controversy. The record of market-driven programs is mixed. On the one hand, the nation's acid rain program uses marketable permits and is widely credited with cutting sulfur oxides at less cost. On the other hand, the world's first market-driven program to tackle urban smog has not worked in Los Angeles, where nearly 400 power companies and manufacturers failed to achieve significant cleanup for the nearly eight years the program has been in effect. Further, many environmental groups are wary of market-driven programs because by design they preclude active government intervention. Critics say such programs could potentially limit public review of power plant operations, allow emissions to concentrate in poor communities and slow efforts to cut haze in national parks downwind from plants that elect to buy pollution credits instead of cleaning up. The Bush administration's power plant strategy was aired before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), whose dramatic departure from the GOP threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. Jeffords is proposing legislation, different from the administration's approach, that would control four power plant pollutants, including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, an approach rejected by the Bush administration. Prospects appear to be increasing that Congress will pass one or more measures designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a belated response to this week's decision by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem without the involvement of the United States. Indeed, in recent weeks several members in the GOP-led House and Democratic Senate have voted on bills with the intention of disassociating themselves from President Bush's environmental policies before the next election. Among the votes, the House struck down a provision supported by the Bush administration that could hinder progress on global climate change policy. The Senate banned new coal mining and oil and gas drilling in national monuments. Other recent rebuffs included rejections of administration initiatives on such issues as the Endangered Species Act, hard-rock mining regulations and offshore drilling for oil and gas. Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Federal Caps Didn't Deter Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits. By NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER July 27 2001 SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. ""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California."" Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California, which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity, according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, ""We're looking at the data, and we question whether or not it is correct."" A combination of cool weather, heavy conservation, the start-up of new power plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks. Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour. The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten, Wolak said. Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June 19, he said. The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO, a Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts. As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall, Cal-ISO workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with just hours to spare. Since then, the market has stabilized, and Cal-ISO's purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes. RELATED STORY Power profits: Power plant operator Calpine said its quarterly profit more than doubled. C2 Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Calpine profits double on skyrocketing sales Escalating power prices inspire plant building program Carolyn Said, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, July 27, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> URL: BU234287.DTL> Fueled by high electricity prices, power generator Calpine Corp. reported strong second-quarter results yesterday. Calpine of San Jose said profit for the quarter ended June 30 almost doubled to $107.7 million (32 cents per share) from $59.5 million (20 cents) during the year-ago quarter. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million a year ago. Excluding charges related to the acquisition of Canada's Encal Energy, Calpine's net income was $132.2 million (39 cents), well above the 31 cents per share predicted by analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Calpine is on an ambitious path to expand its roster of generating plants. By the end of 2005, it expects to have 75,000 megawatts in operation in the United States, including 12,000 megawatts in California. A megawatt is about enough power for 1,000 homes. The company, which generates 2,428 megawatts in California, this summer opened the state's first two major power plants in a decade. The new plants in Yuba City (Sutter County) and Pittsburg generate 547 and 555 megawatts, respectively. Combined with a new plant in Arizona that sells power to California, Calpine's new facilities helped the state stave off threatened blackouts this summer, Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright said. Calpine is building the 847-megawatt Delta Energy Center in Pittsburg, scheduled to open in May, and a 750-megawatt plant in Kern County, due in June 2003. It is also awaiting an August decision by the California Energy Commission on its proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose. ""California is a very good market for us,"" said Bill Highlander, a Calpine spokesman. ""The pricing in California has benefited Calpine."" However, he said, the company was not one of the traders that focused on making top dollar in California's volatile spot market, because its business model concentrated on selling electricity through long-term contracts. During the past few months, Calpine signed 10-year and 20-year contracts with the state for as much as 2,500 megawatts, at prices ranging from $58.60 to $73 per megawatt hour. With most of its plants fired by natural gas, Calpine wants to control about a quarter of the gas it uses, Highlander said. Its April purchase of Encal Energy for $1.77 billion more than doubled its gas reserves, to about 1. 7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, according to Hoover's Online. Calpine's stock closed up $1.08 at $36.89 yesterday.

In one case, an energy company charged as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, which were imposed June 20. State grid operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy, Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Corp., and Williams Cos. The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California set at $101 per megawatt-hour. Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant, however, asked as much as $540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall, the company's average bid was close to costs, the report said. The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California."" The Cal-ISO report singled out Duke Energy, noting it ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs.""

Saying the permit was illegally awarded, the suit warns that the resulting project will damage the ecologically important Elkorn Slough. Voices of the Wetlands accuses the board that awarded the permit of violating federal law by not requiring Duke to use the best possible technology to minimize impacts on the environment around the Moss Landing power plant. If plans to expand the plant proceed without change, the group said, it would kill off critical organisms at the bottom of the food chain. The suit, filed in Monterey County against the California State Water Resources Control Board and the regional board that serves the central coast, seeks a court order to return the case to the regional water district so that more environmentally sensitive cooling technology can be ordered for use at the plant. State officials said yesterday that the issues raised in the suit were considered and rejected during the initial permit approval process last year, and again during the appeal process this year. The case comes amid enormous pressure on state officials, in light of California's energy crisis, to rapidly accelerate power plant approvals and expand the amount of power generation available. Against this backdrop, the state water board on June 21 essentially rejected environmental groups' appeal that had sought to overturn the district board's decision approving the Moss Landing expansion permit. On another front, board members of the California Energy Commission took testimony earlier this week on a proposal to curtail public review of plant project proposals, with one board member, Robert A. Laurie, acknowledging in an interview that he believed ""in some cases"" it posed one of the most time- consuming aspects of project approval. A recommendation is expected within the next month. Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., bought the Moss Landing plant from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1998, when the Northern California utility sold off many of its facilities to prepare for deregulation of the energy market. The plant was built in 1950 using a cooling system technology that sucks water out of the Elkorn Slough and Monterey Bay to cool generating turbines before spitting the water out into the Pacific Ocean. The group says wildlife conditions and sea otter population have improved markedly since PG&E mothballed many of the generating units at Moss Landing in 1995. But Duke now is proposing to resurrect parts of the cooling system in a major expansion that will make Moss Landing the state's largest power plant after its completion next summer. With an output of 2,538 megawatts, the plant when completed is expected to account for 30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next year, serving about 2.5 million households in the Monterey, Santa Cruz and southern Santa Clara County areas, including San Jose. Regional water quality board officials declined comment yesterday, citing the pending litigation. But in public documents filed yesterday, water officials said cooling alternatives had been considered and rejected. The documents did not elaborate on why they were not mandated. Duke had acknowledged during the process that more ecologically sensitive technologies were available, but at prohibitive costs of $20 million to $50 million more. Deborah Sivas, an attorney for the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic, which filed the suit on behalf of Voices of the Wetlands, considered the best technology alternatives mandatory, not optional. She said the board had not considered alternative approaches in reaching its conclusions.

Take the Edison bail out as evidence. At its essence, the deal works like this: Taxpayers give the utility a big pile of cash; the state gets some old, rickety transmission lines in return. Don't be fooled: The power bounty is basically a political ploy. The state doesn't need to control electric distribution. What politicos need is a face-saving trade as evidence that this is a business deal - not a government handout. The state probably should just write the check and eat its losses. But if bureaucrats wanted real remuneration from this bail out, California would eye some juicy Edison assets. As a public service, I'll list a few. Now, for argument's sake, I won't differentiate between the utility and its parent company, Edison International. Hey, lawyers built those walls between the two. Let 'em figure out how to take 'em down. For starters, you'd figure an energy-strapped state would like some regional power plants, no? Like the San Onofre facility. However, it might be laughable to see Sacramento-types defending their future handling of the local nuclear plant. OK, if that's a tad too dicey for the state, how about a coal-fired plant in Nevada? Heck, Edison had a buyer at half a billion bucks before the state oddly quashed that deal. Maybe the state could grab it from Edison -- then flip it to pay off electricity-related debts. Of course, buying one of the out-of-town power plants that Edison's sister company in Irvine has acquired might be educational for Sacramento. Owning a plant in Illinois or Pennsylvania or possibly New Zealand might show state honchos how easy - or not - it is to rig supply and prices. Alternatively, the state could demand a small entity called Edison Capital. Basically, it's a bank. One specialty: the politically correct field of affordable-housing lending. A good fit for bureaucrats. Speaking of money, there's the Edison pension plan. Governments are really good at running retirement benefits. Heck, California already has a huge one. There's got to be some economies of scale - real cash savings - in merging the Edison plan with some state pension fund. Do note that Edison's plan might be overfunded by about $400 million. You can bet, though, that the state would never have the nerve to play 1980s corporate raider: profiting by grabbing some of a company's overfunded retirement kitty. Finally, there's Edison International Field in Anaheim. Stadium naming-rights contracts must have some value since corporations always seem to fight over these promotional gimmicks. (The utility's parent company paid $50 million in 1997 for two decades of ""free"" publicity.) Imagine the buzz the state could get out of the huge sign age on a nationally renowned stadium. Plus, maybe the Angels could be good corporate citizens and tie into this deal. It's possible they'd allow a slight change in the team name to better emphasize the state's role in the ballpark. So, how does ""California Angels"" sound to you? Business; Financial Desk California Sempra Continues Improved Results NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Sempra Energy on Thursday reported another quarter of higher earnings and revenue, a sharp contrast to California 's bigger and beleaguered investor-owned utilities. Although California 's electricity crisis has pushed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electricity into insolvency--and PG&E into U.S. Bankruptcy Court--the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas continues to post improved results on the strength of its non-utility businesses. Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25% to $137 million, or 66 cents a share, up $25 million, or 55 cents, earned a year ago, the San Diego-based utility holding company said. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating income rose 24% to $291 million. Sempra's earnings came in just ahead of the 65-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. ""Our strong second-quarter performance is primarily the result of our efforts to accelerate growth through new businesses,"" Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's chairman, chief executive and president, told analysts in a conference call. Sempra is in a vastly different position than Edison International and PG&E Corp. because its electric utility arm was able to avoid the deep financial woes afflicting their respective Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric utilities. SDG&E was first to sell its power plants two years ago and thus was freed from a rate freeze. That in turn allowed the utility to pass along to customers the soaring costs of electricity beginning last summer. The state Legislature eventually rolled back and capped the rates for SDG&E customers, but promised the utility it would be allowed to recover those losses. Edison and PG&E, however, continued to accumulate staggering debts because their retail rate freezes remained in place. In contrast, Sempra is solvent, with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion in available credit, Baum said. The performance of its utilities was lackluster, with Southern California Gas earning $47 million, unchanged from the second quarter of 2000, and SDG&E earning $37 million, down from $40 million in the year-ago period. But Sempra's unregulated businesses--including energy trading, power plant construction and operation, international electricity operations and energy services--turned in an overall strong performance, contributing 39% of the parent company's earnings. Sempra's trading unit provided most of that profit, contributing $69 million to second-quarter net income compared with $40 million in the same quarter last year. Sempra's stock gained 17 cents to close at $25.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Business; Financial Desk California Calpine Doubles Earnings, Beats Forecasts Energy: San Jose-based company credits higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Calpine Corp., one of the biggest U.S. power-plant builders, said Thursday that second-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating estimates, because of higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. Profit from operations rose to $132.2 million, or 39 cents a share, from net income of $59.5 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion. San Jose-based Calpine opened plants in the U.S. with a combined capacity of 1,545 megawatts--enough to light 1.5 million average homes--and benefited from existing plants in California . Calpine has insulated itself from rising fuel costs by buying natural-gas fields to supply its plants. ""Given the strategy they have chosen, they're following through quite well,"" said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets Co. ""They are growing from a small base and adding a lot of plants, so we'd expect high growth."" Profit topped the 31-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Calpine said it expects to earn $2 a share this year. The average First Call forecast was $1.92, with a range of $1.80 to $2.04. Calpine's shares rose $1.08, or 3%, to close at $36.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen 21% this year amid concern that generators might have to give back some of the profit they made selling power in California during the last year. In addition, cooler-than-normal weather and conservation efforts recently reduced power prices in the state. Calpine runs or is building natural gas plants in 29 U.S. states and Canada that produce more than 30,000 megawatts of power. The company plans to more than double capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005. Calpine this month opened the $350-million Sutter plant, California 's first major generator in more than a decade. The company is building 11 plants to run during times of peak demand in the state and getting permits for four more, James Macias, who oversees Calpine's West Coast power plants, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Separately, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp., a power producer that supplies California and operates in 27 countries, said second-quarter profit fell 20% because of losses tied to currency fluctuations and the sale of a U.S. electricity retailer. Net income fell to $112 million, or 21 cents a share, from $140 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $2.21 billion.

Calpine Net Soars On Added Plants; Sempra Profit Rises By Rebecca Smith 07/27/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page B4 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter, reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building program. Meanwhile, the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., said net was $107.7 million, or 32 cents a share, up from $59.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, included a special charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy Ltd., a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly, soaring to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million. Separately, Sempra Energy, parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & Electric, reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth, which stands in marked contrast to the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy companies, to Sempra's unregulated operations. Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal Units for natural gas, up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time, Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose, to $71.03 in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. At Sempra, Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit, San Diego Gas & Electric, fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat at its gas-distribution company, Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy Trading was the big profit center, generating half its total profit, or $69 million, compared with $40 million a year earlier. Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock, which trades at a low price/earnings multiple of 10, still is being ""affected negatively by the California situation."" He also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants.

My friend, = Ol=01, Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California. In fact, so do I. Yesterday=01,s Joint Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either Dave=01,s or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation. =01&The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmission,=018 he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers. =01&Come to think of it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=018 I recalled, =01&Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build them. I can=01,t remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=018 I know what you are thinking right now. The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates. That recipe should be out of the PUC=01,s oven sometime next week. =01&Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the ISO=01,s bid cap. There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=018 Dave added. =01&So you agree with Herr (Hair) Peace! You don=01,t believe in markets,=018 I retorted. = =01&Oh, I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade, and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest market went against me,=018 Dave recalled. =01&I called everyone who I tra= ded with, and they had nothing. I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what will it cost for 50 MW?=018 =01&Why didn=01,t you ask for 300?=018 I wondered. =01&I didn=01,t want to= show him my position. You get hosed when you show the buyer your position. Ask for 50, first,=018 Dave chided. =01&What happened?=018 =01&Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH. I said I= =01,d take it, and then said I needed another fifty. He asked $300. I took that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=018 lamented Dave. =01&He just wanted to see how far he could push me. That=01,s what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it.=018 =01&But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess at the price. Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess wrong. But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant.=018 And there you have it. Put in a price cap, and the traders have a target for which to shoot. I can=01,t prove the following, yet, but I=01,l= l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average trading price climbs even as the so-called =01&dysfunctional=018 price spik= es are eliminated. Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint. I feel better already. Here is what is on our short agenda this week. >>> Things in the Mailbag >>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) >>> Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch. Here is what my friends have been writing me. FPL Energy=01,s Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =01&Please Gary= , no more whining about your computer. How old are you?? Is this the year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment. Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay??? Please let us know what is going on with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron??? Bay!!!!=018 It is good to have friends like Steve. They make the pain of separation so much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity. How about Fentergy PLus? Next, from the PX=01,s Mark Hoppe, who writes, =01&As you've heard from others, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama). Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate. I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market.=018 Thanks, Mark. I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence. I have learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk (write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience. A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=01,s Jennifer Sherwood a note, which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=01,s. It=01,s okay, Jennifer. I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions are cool with us. =01&Just curious - has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices? What I mean is, we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months? No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank. No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon. The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause. Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =01+I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=01, vs. =01+I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=01,=018 Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not telling who, I received the following: =01&I ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote. Ugh! I too noted that the ""speak fast"" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace. My goodness, what a mess we have. I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes. My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored] ... for political reasons. Given no Commission meetings til September, the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do all that much.=018 >>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=01,s reply to the PUC/EOB report was very good. I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito. The full document can be found on the ISO=01,s website. =01&... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. =01&The Report states that the ISO =01&never tried=018 to call upon consume= rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =01&The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by =01+purchasers=01, of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts, which are designed to =01&lock-in=018 a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. =01&In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =01&might well= =018 have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of peak demand, when all of the state=01,s generation has been exhausted, the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=01,s control area. =01&The Report asserts that California power markets =01&are not now competitive=018 and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =01&market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand,=018 and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =01&The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=01,s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants in the FERC proceedings. =01&The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=018 >>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring. Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their facts. Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=01,s Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like. It started over two hours late. The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to heap on the glory. That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese. Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it, and he does, it is always the same story. It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy. They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day. The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable. Last week, San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=01,m not making that up ... He said it). He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done listening. People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes. Yikes! Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!! Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem, it is a regional problem. One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=01, Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a 6 month permitting time line. The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and air offsets. Hmmmmmm. That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC. The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch. I went too hard on her last week, calling her Let=01,s Do Lynch. That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry. I promise to be nicer starting now. The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured. Put it in an escrow account. Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you). The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento. Isn=01,t that a switch? Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord. Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected. When can we do that? Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer. There is a process. It takes time. You must have evidence. FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable. It=01,s based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high prices. You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals. Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12. They were stumped. Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=01,t you, Mr. Smith of FERC, today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner. Back and forth: the process, the process, the process. There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC. Today, I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob. For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC. >>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well, the official title is, =01&Order Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas & Electric Company=018. I like my title better. This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission, on August 3. It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center. Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address: =01=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a= nd small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market?) =01=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess reasonableness? Are SDG&E=01,s purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms? =01=07 What is SDG&E=01,s obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre= nt customers? =01=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and irregularities? How should state/federal concerns be addressed? =01=07 What are the causes of the price increases? Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases? Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole? >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) As promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb Ennis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.

They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and everyone would die. No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children and giving in to men.

 ege and Work Product","""Ronald Carroll"" <rcarroll@bracepatt.com>",dasovich-j,"While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, Subpart D) pertain only to ""proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such proceedings as the Commission may order."" 18 CFR 385.401. In this case, FERC stated that ""a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . ."" and specifically rejected the use of a ""trial-type evidentiary hearing."" Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate ""paper"" hearings with ""trial-type"" hearings; see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh. B? Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion, why should it answer? Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action. >>> ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>> I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market.

One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended for CA Large Consumers. Nader sent someone. No other consumers. One other ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego). Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The prices are quite divergent. He expresses concern at the little offered. Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers). IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so. Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now. Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate increase. Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough Enron able to take low profile. SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing could be achieved. Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed epithets at SDG&E and SCE. SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning. Out of the Room Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators. Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs. Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable resolution. Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court. His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates. Generators oppose this, I believe. Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.",important

The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 16000).

67094,2001-03-12 09:00:00,Re: news/updates,Steven J Kean,dasovich-j,"As to whether long term contracting by Cal. is a good idea, the answer is somewhat mixed. We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting. Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases. California is pursuing the latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements. In the short term, we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases.

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs By Rebecca Smith 09/01/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A4 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power rates to levels seen prior to deregulation . Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that commodity price. The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier. Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to schools and hospitals. In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost. Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the rate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or December 2003. Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through December 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it ""creates tremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance new projects such as a new transmission line. The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that review the plans.

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of the bill"" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting. That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short, little has changed since yesterday. Best, Jeff",important

Davis To Respond Immedia= tely to Inquiries Washington (July 11) - House Energy and Commerce Commit= tee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Ch= airman Joe Barton (R-TX) today sent the following letter to California Gove= rnor Gray Davis: July 11, 2001 The Honorable Gray Davis Governor State o= f California State Capitol Sacramento, California 95814 Dear Governor Da= vis: As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently c= onsidered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist Califo= rnia in resolving its energy supply crisis. One of these measures was a te= mporary ""safe harbor"" provision, effective only upon the California Governo= r's request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplant= s from challenges under the Clean Air Act. During the course o= f six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held on the Calif= ornia electric crisis, including two hearings on draft legislation, Members= of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants we= re vulnerable to legal challenge, even with written ""agreements"" for extend= ed operation between state air officials and the powerplants. Nevertheless= , California officials testifying or providing information on behalf of you= r state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary= . I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the= concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our int= erpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate. On Jun= e 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against t= hree electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero po= wer plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emerg= ency extended operation. On the same day, the City and County of San Franc= isco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against the= three Potrero units. All parties involved in the litigation strongly asse= rt that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and th= e Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all availa= ble legal remedies under federal and state law. The legal acti= on against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extende= d operation violates limits contained in federal air permits and seeks fine= s potentially amounting to millions of dollars. Understandably, as a resul= t of this potentially huge fine, the operator of the Potrero power plant ha= s filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify t= hat it will not be required to operate the three generating units, even dur= ing periods of electrical emergency. Thus, the mere filing of this lawsuit= could have a near-term impact of the amount of power available in Californ= ia. Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that subs= tantial amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other faci= lities in California could also be subject to similar legal action. The Ca= lifornia Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 mega= watts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hou= rs of operation. In addition, several new units are being brought on-line = this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment. According to= incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board= (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may e= xhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prio= r to this summer's peak demand period. These units may represent up to 2% = of generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a = Stage III electric emergency. Although presented with written = requests for information from the Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could no= t or would not provide the Committee with precise information on units that= may have been off-line due to permit limits, a projection of the number of= generating units that will face permit constraints that could cause such u= nits to be off-line, the amount of generation associated with these facilit= ies, the possible impact of these units on system reliability, and addition= al information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operat= ing under ""modified"" conditions. We believe that in the face of the pendi= ng legal action, it is even more important that such information be accurat= ely and objectively determined. As we mentioned above, over se= veral months in the spring and early summer of this year, the Committee sou= ght California's support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to pr= otect the extended operation of certain powerplants. Regrettably, the Comm= ittee did not receive any support from your administration for such changes= to the law, as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this= letter. Instead, witnesses representing California claimed such a legal s= afe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary -- even if it could onl= y be granted during periods of emergency and upon your personal request to = the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It appears now tha= t citizen groups in California -- as well as the City and County of San Fra= ncisco -- do not believe that the actions taken by you, your state agencies= and local air quality districts are legal. The pending litigation challen= ges the very agreements which California previously claimed granted suffici= ent legal ""flexibility"" to keep these units running during times of emergen= cy. It is time, then, to reconsider this issue. So that the C= ommittee may understand the extent of this critical situation and respond a= ccordingly, we would ask for your consideration of the following: (1) We w= ould urge you to reply fully to the Committee's earlier requests that CARB = specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopa= rdy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potent= ially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act. We should have a = clear idea of the power production which is at risk. (2) In view of the fa= ct that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of lega= l fact and several California generating units are now being sued under aut= horities contained in the Clean Air Act, we ask whether you will now favor = creating in federal law a limited, environmentally-neutral safe harbor for = these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to = EPA. (3) Finally, we would ask that if you support such legislation, that = you work with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue= in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in Californi= a this summer.

Alan Comnes Meeting went from about 10:30 to 1 p.m. Written materials discussed at this meeting are available at www.caiso.com/bog. 1. Budget. Board approved budget, which contains a significant increase in GMCs and, for the first time applies GMC fees, on the self provision of A/S. The motion to adopt was modified to say the Board would revisit budget if, in response to Gov. Davis requests to par budgets, the CAISO budget is cut. 2. Retirement plan Audit 3. Allocation of Above-MCP 487 charges. This mechanism will improve the allocation of OOM costs so that the per-MWh charges match up with actual OOM costs. Stated that penalty revenues used to lower OOM costs could come from imbalance penalties. Action. approved (?) to allow staff to make a tariff amendment on this change. 4. Winter Assessment. Presentation by staff Kahn took issue (i.e., did not even want staff report presented) that CAISO does an assessment without consulting the Power Authority, CPUC, and the CEC. Worried about conflicting with the other resource assessments out there and giving media ways to take shots at DWR buying practices. In the end, the full presentation was not given but questions were asked about whether the assessment spells trouble or provides assurance. The answer: things are tight in some months but are expected to be ok given the level of conservative assumptions used in the analysis. Action: staff was tasked to compare this assessment with CEC's and others and come back in another month. 5. Generator maintenance program. Will use GADS data. This program is mandatory for PGA generator units. CAISO staffer represented that no other ISO has a prescriptive program like the one CAISO is proposing. Current schedule: brief FERC staff next week, return to Board in November for approval, make FERC filing, implement in early '02. Benchmarks are based on each unit's historical performance; i.e. dogs will be benchmarked against their past doggy behavior. There is no component to raise the ""bar"" on performance but a unit that falls relative to past performance would trigger further review. 6. MSC Selection Committee. MSC provides ""independent"" review of the CAISO markets for CAISO, the state, and FERC. Wolak is the only member left at the moment. Selection committee will be Sheffrin, Wolak, and Borenstein. Candidates will go to Exec. Director and the final candidates to the Board in February 2002 (!). Kahn questioned how the MSC can survive with only one member and take until February 02 to select a final members. Nonetheless, the glacially paced schedule was adopted. 7. FERC RTO Seams Issues. Steve Greenleaf presented. Updated BOG on RTO week and said that the ""4 RTO"" model took a step backward (""off the table"" in the words of Chair Wood) in response to criticism from state PUCs on Thursday. (Is this an accurate recounting of Day 4?). ISO is engaged in interregional coordination. Mentioned ""CSIC"" group Mentions SSGWY's (?)sponsorship of a market monitoring workshop on November 16. 8. Update of CERS Settlement BEEP/AS Payment Procedure. Edison and PG&E ""are making progress"" but no agreement with CERS have been reached. SDG&E signed and the procedure was implemented at least in part with SDG&E. 9. Monthly reports: financial. 10. Monthly reports: DMA. Sheffrin. Mostly followed the briefing charts. Emphasized the following: CERS OOM purchases are generally down and are reasonably priced once purchases and sales are disaggregated. Said that suppliers are still bidding above costs. DMA files confidential reports that include info on bidding data weekly to FERC. Bids are not coming down. Intrazonal congestion is up due to new generation coming on line. That allows generators to play the ""dec"" game.",important

Just about everyone has an opinion about how to solve California's energy problems. From building more power plants to capping prices to doing away with deregulation, federal regulators, consumer advocates, economists and energy companies all have weighed in with plans for ending the electricity shortages and financial distress that have troubled the state over the past year. Here is a look at what some say California should do now: LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD For many, the solution to California's energy woes is to increase the supply of power in the state by building more power plants. A greater supply from more sources would bring wholesale prices down. And two California economists, Severin Borenstein at the University of California's Energy Institute in Berkeley and Peter Navarro at the University of California at Irvine, argue that the impact would be particularly pronounced in areas where electricity generators now have monopoly or near-monopoly power. ""We need to build more power plants in close proximity to the ones where companies have market power,"" says Mr. Borenstein. The problem, the economists say, is that some areas of the state have only one power plant, so the energy suppliers can manipulate the price by reducing output at a certain plant when demand is high in order to boost prices. California does get some power from generators in the Northwest and Canada. But because demand is so great in the state and throughout the entire region and supply is limited, what is brought in doesn't make much of a dent. The economists add that because suppliers, including Williams Co., Duke Energy, Mirant Corp. and Enron Corp., have this freedom to charge whatever the market will bear, they can take unfair advantage of consumers. For instance, in Carlsbad, a community in San Diego, only one power plant owned by Duke Energy provides electricity to utilities in that area. The company has no competition, so it has the ability to set the price for its power, according to state Sen. Joseph Dunn, a Democrat from Santa Ana who has set up a Senate committee to investigate manipulation in the wholesale power market. ""If you need electricity and there's only one place to buy it, and everyone wants it, you're going to pay through the nose,"" says Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University and the director of a power-market monitoring committee, which monitors the wholesale electricity market to identify anticompetitive behavior. ""Is this fair? No. Something must be done about it."" Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams says the company denies that it has ever done this and rejects allegations that it has manipulated the price of electricity. Spokespeople for the other companies also deny such allegations, saying prices have surged because demand has outstripped supply. Partly to prevent possible abuse of market power by suppliers, the Independent System Operator, which runs California's grid, contracted with energy companies to have them operate some power plants as ""reliability must-run"" units. In return for a fixed annual payment from the state, the companies agreed to make these plants available at a moment's notice to balance supply and demand. Electricity from the plants was priced based on the price of natural gas and other variable operating costs. In 1999, the ISO canceled two-thirds of the RMR contracts because the units were rarely called upon, due to a steady supply of power in the state, and the expense of the contracts to the state. When power prices surged in 2000, however, the ISO didn't use the remaining contracts to help keep supply in balance and power costs down. An ISO spokesman says the agency doesn't ""have a reason to explain why the RMR contracts weren't utilized."" He declined to comment further. CAP PRICES While many, including Gov. Davis, see more power plants as a long-term solution to the state's energy woes, they advocate capping the prices of energy sold on the spot market as an interim solution to keep the market stable while the plants are being constructed. ""In the short term, we need price caps,"" Gov. Davis has said to state legislators. ""That means that [power generators] get all their costs back and a 40% or 50% profit, which in this economy is pretty darn good."" Robert Glynn, chief executive officer of PG&E Corp. unit Pacific Gas & Electric, which sold some of its generating plants during deregulation, adds that price caps will ""keep wholesale prices low while new power plants are built."" For more than a year, the governor had urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to place a temporary cap on electricity sold in the spot market, saying the move would save the state's consumers billions of dollars on their energy bills while new power plants are being built. In May, after many months of rejecting the idea, the agency imposed an initial cap on prices in California during emergencies. In June, it extended the cap to other Western states and established that it would remain in effect at all times. Wholesale electricity prices at first fell in response to the caps, but surged again during a spate of hot weather in early July. FERC has been forced to make a number of adjustments to the cap as a result. These price caps, however, will expire in September 2002. Gov. Davis believes the caps need to stay in effect longer -- for three years -- to allow for the construction of new plants. RESTORE CREDIT-WORTHINESS Rebuilding a financial base for utilities is key to putting California's power market back on track. One way to do this, some experts say, is to let the utilities sell bonds to help them pay off debts and recoup the billions of dollars they've lost buying power at prices they couldn't afford. This would then allow the utilities to get investment-grade ratings. ""All California has to do is to ensure the utilities are credit-worthy again"" via the bond sale, says John Bryson, president and chief executive officer of Edison International, the Rosemead, Calif., parent of Southern California Edison Co. So far, the California Assembly and Senate have proposed that Southern California Edison sell $2.9 billion in revenue bonds, backed by a surcharge tacked onto the bills of the state's largest businesses, to pay off its commercial paper holders and alternative-power producers, such as wind and solar generators. The utility has a contract with the alternative-power producers, and the price it pays for power is fixed. But the utility has defaulted on those payments. The state believes that Edison International needs to help rescue its struggling utility. A $400 million tax rebate that Edison International is expected to receive from the federal government also could be applied to help the utility out of its financial crisis. ""The state needs to provide some stability to Edison so we can get back in the power business again,"" says Mr. Bryson. ""It's a pretty straightforward solution."" While utilities still continue to deliver electricity to consumers, the state has had to step in to buy the power on their behalf. Energy companies are currently refusing to sell power to the utilities, fearing they won't get paid because the utilities have defaulted on prior payments and have no credit. California's 1996 deregulation law uncapped wholesale power prices, but froze the rate the utilities could charge consumers. When wholesale prices surged in both the spot and day-ahead markets, running well above what the utilities could charge customers, the utilities couldn't do anything about it because the state deregulation law didn't allow them to sign long-term supply contracts. Restoring the utilities' credit-worthiness, however, may not be as quick as Mr. Bryson makes it sound given the huge sums that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric owe the energy companies that sold them electricity. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy-court protection in April and is trying to write a reorganization plan in just six months, pay off all of its creditors in full and return to the power business, says the company's Mr. Glynn. CONSERVE ENERGY A massive conservation effort ""that busts the energy cartel,"" by reducing demand and, thus, lowering the price of wholesale power, is the only way to save the state in the short term, says Harvey Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a consumer-advocacy group in Santa Monica, Calif. ""Only if demand falls so greatly that members of the energy cartel are forced to break ranks and lower prices will conservation solve the short-term problem."" Gov. Davis says Californians already are conserving at a record rate. For example, in July Californians boosted conservation efforts during the day by 11%, compared with the same time last year. Conservation efforts have been suggested from the use of halogen light bulbs to running washing machines in the evening to setting the thermostat at 78 degrees. REREGULATE Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer-advocacy group based in San Francisco, believes the state should return to the days when utilities monopolized the power market. Back then, she says, power supplies were abundant and prices preset. ""It was working just fine back then,"" Ms. Hoge says. ""It's not until we opened this state up to so-called competition that everything started to go in the toilet. Look at us now: We're like a Third World country. We can barely keep the lights on."" She says regulation would let consumers know what the price of electricity is and that price would stay the same regardless of fluctuations in supply and demand. California wouldn't ""be held hostage by out-of-state energy companies that not only control the price of electricity but also control the supply,"" Ms. Hoge says. But some experts say that under federal law, it might be impossible for states to reclaim authority over power plants that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government. And it would cost billions of dollars to construct new government-owned generators or buy back with public funds old utility plants. LEAVE MARKETS ALONE Others believe that California's electricity markets should be left alone to evolve and become more competitive. The state should resist putting in constraints, like price caps, a number of Wall Street firms have advised the state. Merrill Lynch & Co., Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs & Co. are among companies that helped the state and its utilities try to come up with financial solutions earlier this year to help ease the energy problem. None of the plans were implemented, however. ""The state needs to get out of power business,"" says Richard Cortwright, an energy analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. The goal of any new plan should be to eliminate what's left of regulation, says Susan Abbott, an executive director at Moody's Investor Service Inc. ""State regulators restricted the utilities from signing forward contracts [locking in power supply at a fixed price], they capped retail rates and never encouraged retail choice,"" says Ms. Abbott. ""That's the antithesis of a competitive market. Until the state understands competition, this energy crisis will just continue to fester for years to come."" --- Mr. Leopold is chief of the Los Angeles bureau for Dow Jones Newswires. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- Looking to Washington: What can the feds do to make deregulation a less bumpy process? By Vasugi V. Ganeshananthan 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- Before California's energy problems began, support was building for congressional action on national electricity deregulation. But this year, says Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, a longtime proponent, ""support for deregulation is not there, in my opinion."" Still, even without a comprehensive package, the federal government could take some crucial partial steps toward more-open power markets. Some in Congress have backed measures that would lead to ""restructuring,"" as opposed to deregulation. That could involve such steps as settling more authority on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure reliability and access to the transmission grid. Another target for Congress will be the remaining antiquated laws and regulations designed for the days of monopolies, when each utility had its own borders. The aim is to fix troubled wholesale markets to set the stage for states to elect to deregulate at the retail level. ""I think it would be in the industry's best interest for this Congress to deal with some of the issues that have been hanging out there for some time,"" says Rick Shapiro, managing director of local and governmental affairs at Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy giant. In Congress so far this year, several bills have been introduced. The energy bill the House passed in early August offered some modest measures to foster competition, such as tax breaks to utilities joining regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, which FERC has asked energy companies to create to operate the power grid. Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, plans to introduce even more restructuring legislation this fall. His bill may address reliability, transmission and incentives for building power plants, among other issues. And Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has plans for a bill of his own: His main point is to enhance FERC's authority to address power-market problems like reliability and fair access to the grid. But among other issues, he is making the latest of several pushes over the past few years to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which was designed to prevent large national companies from dominating the industry. Though Congress in 1992 passed the Energy Policy Act permitting competition among wholesale electricity suppliers, the 1935 law still limits certain investments by utility holding companies. And many say it impedes competition. Sen. Bingaman also wants to repeal the parts of 1978's Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act that mandate the use of renewable energy, though he has said he still supports promoting renewable energy. Of course, there are longstanding, thorny issues that make federal action on energy markets a tough sell. While some Democrats, like Mr. Bingaman, are interested in the topic, the party in general is less in favor of deregulation than are Republican lawmakers. Thus, the recent Democratic takeover of the Senate is widely considered a setback. And while some regions strongly favor change, others don't. For instance, many Western states -- including Washington, whose Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee -- are feeling the ill effects of deregulation in California and are thus leery. Naysayers point to what they say was FERC inaction regarding inadequate power supplies and controversial pricing auctions. ""From California's perspective, FERC failed miserably by doing nothing for month after month after month,"" says Rep. Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California. ""I fear we might make the same mistake at the national level that California made at the state level."" But deregulation advocates think nationwide deregulation is inevitable. ""Would you like to be in an airport where there is one airline from here to Atlanta? Or an airport where there are three airlines, including a low-cost option?"" says Marc Yacker, director of government and public affairs for the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, a Washington, D.C., group of large industrial electricity users. If regulated states ""see that residents in Pennsylvania and Texas have a well-functioning electricity system . . . they will change."" Here are some of the main issues currently being hashed out in Washington: -- WHOLESALE MARKETS: Before any serious discussion of consumer deregulation can take place, Mr. Bingaman thinks wholesale markets need to be fixed. Among his main points: clarification of FERC and state jurisdiction. A recent white paper from him outlining his planned legislation calls for Congress to clarify that FERC is the ultimate authority over all transmission issues, with the power to overrule states. The paper adds, ""Legislation should affirm FERC's authority to order utilities to join regional transmission organizations."" Such powers, the thinking goes, would allow FERC to ensure that power transmission is fair and that access is free of any favoritism among affiliated utilities. And that would go a long way toward fixing wholesale markets and paving the way for retail deregulation should individual states choose to participate. ""To leave electricity legislation for another day would be to ensure that the problems faced now in the West will be replicated across the country,"" he wrote in the paper. -- FEDERAL AUTHORITY: The extent to which a federal entity should have authority over power markets is a contentious issue. Mr. Bingaman desires far-reaching powers for FERC. And power suppliers favor having federal regulators hold sway over transmission issues. Eugene Peters of the Electric Power Supply Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group for competitive power producers, says FERC ""has a role here in that they can essentially create a national template."" Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has also said she will push to get more authority for FERC in order to ensure that all power prices are reasonable -- for instance, by assessing civil penalties to power suppliers who engage in unfair pricing. But some in the energy industry say FERC already has plenty of authority -- it's just that the commissioners haven't exercised it properly. Opponents of extending FERC's role fear a tangle of federal bureaucracy reaching a local level. ""I think that, if FERC exercises the authority that I believe that they have in many of these areas, legislation is not necessary,"" says Dave Penn, executive vice president of American Public Power Association, a trade group of public utilities based in Washington, D.C. FERC itself isn't arguing strenuously for more authority. Chairman Pat Wood says additional affirmations of authority would probably save the agency time in court later. And he says he wouldn't mind having the ability to assess penalties on utilities that fail to provide reliable service. But he adds, ""While I welcome any authority they want to give us, what we've got in the statute now is plenty good enough."" -- TRANSMISSION: Transmission is an industrywide beef; it's widely acknowledged that with electricity now being sold over greater distances, the current system is overtaxed, risking bottlenecks and reliability problems. So the nation needs more lines. But who decides where to put them? Plus, with the same people selling power and running transmission lines, there's a natural inclination for those controlling the transmission lines to want to sell their own electricity first. FERC has ordered the industry to institute RTOs to run the transmission system to ensure fair access to transmission lines, no matter who owns them. Sen. Bingaman's proposals would affirm that power for FERC. And Mr. Wood says the RTOs can also handle siting of new transmission lines. But many states are unhappy with FERC's strategies. Some, fearing federal interference with the states' authority over siting, are taking steps to form their own multistate councils that would ensure regional cooperation while leaving control in state hands. And Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia are requesting a rehearing of a FERC order that they join RTOs, saying that federal regulators are moving with undue haste even in areas where transmission isn't a problem. -- INTERCONNECTION: In a competitive system, the growing number of new electricity generators must be able to connect to the power grid. But the interconnection of new generators with the old utilities that own the grid's transmission lines can raise two kinds of problems. On the technical side, newer generators can have different types of systems with different generating capacities, raising concerns of overloads and other problems. On the competitive side, utilities can make it difficult for new generators to connect to the grid. So, many in the industry are calling for uniform technical standards to allow equal access to the grid -- once a generator meets the standards, a utility would have no basis to deny a hookup -- and to ensure that interconnection doesn't risk the safety and reliability of the system. ""As we've moved into deregulation, there are more entities that want to connect to the system,"" says Ken Rose, a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University. There must be some means, he says, to ensure that access for all these new players remains fair. FERC's Mr. Wood says interconnection is ""a top priority"" for the agency. He has officially asked utilities to file their interconnection rules, and FERC will issue a policy on interconnection this fall. Chris Mele, legislative director of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Washington, D.C., says that interconnection rules need to be flexible. ""NARUC supports Congress requiring the establishment of national interconnection and power-quality standards that would be developed and adapted by an appropriate technical-standards organization,"" says Mr. Mele. ""However, the states need to have the flexibility to adapt these rules or to adapt their own rules."" --- Ms. Ganeshananthan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau.

Energy (A Special Report) What Happened? --- Lessons From Across the Seas: Deregulation is working pretty well in Britain; But it has taken a long time By Geoffrey T. Smith 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R9 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -- For all those who just can't understand why electricity deregulation is worth bothering with: Look abroad. It has to be admitted that Europe's deregulation experience looks better than the U.S.'s largely because of the relative starting positions. Europe is the 300-pound couch potato who feels more of a difference after a month in the gym than the guy who is already quite fit. For decades, the European electricity industry was run by engineers patronized by politicians. The result: a hugely overbuilt system with rows of underused power plants and legions of unnecessary staff, paid for by sky-high, regulated rates. Deregulation is starting to put an end to all that. Electricity prices have fallen in most European markets, especially in Germany, since a European Union deregulation directive took effect in 1999. And in the United Kingdom, deregulation has gone further than in most of Europe. Electricity prices are down by around a third for families and businesses, and there are few problems with supply. But there is a catch -- an important one for an American public already weary of the pain of deregulation: In Britain, it has taken more than a decade to make deregulation start to work. Britain started out with a few advantages that places such as California don't have. Its policy is in the hands of a single, central government committed to deregulation, while U.S. state and federal regulators often disagree on what needs to be done. It started out owning the whole energy business and could carve it up as it pleased. As it deregulated, it didn't have to face the problem of exploding demand due to Silicon Valley and rapid population growth. And Britain, unlike California, started from a position of significant oversupply, and for years was liberal in allowing still more plants to be built because they would be fueled by cheaper and cleaner North Sea natural gas instead of coal. Despite all this, British electricity deregulation has had its share of false starts. For 10 years up until 1998, the whole process seemed to be bringing little in the way of concrete gains. For much of the decade, the government was a timid pioneer, relying on the blunt policy instrument of price controls to bring prices down when its fancy new market models didn't work. But Britain was also willing to try different approaches if its first choice failed -- perhaps a lesson for the U.S. Like California, Britain set up a wholesale pool for day-to-day power purchases; Britain scrapped the pool when it failed to bring prices down. Britain also allowed power buyers and sellers the crucial freedom to lock in their prices for months ahead, insulating them from the price zigzags that have crippled California's two largest investor-owned utilities and sent the biggest, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. ""The U.K. has got the balance about right, but competition has been a long time in coming,"" says Richard Lewis, U.K. managing director of Enron Corp., Houston. The seeds were sown in 1988, when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decided to extend her free-market ideology to the electricity sector. The British government had a clear idea what it wanted to do. New laws were passed. Deregulation began. By contrast, Germany's federal government, which started the process at the end of 1998, has had to negotiate electricity deregulation with two other tiers of government and more than 800 electricity companies. Britain split the electricity sector into three parts: power generators, completely separate regional suppliers and National Grid PLC, to which it gave ownership and control of the country's high-voltage power lines. By separating the grid from the companies that actually sell and produce electricity, this structure ensured that no seller could keep others out of the market. The government sold majority stakes in all 12 English and Welsh regional electricity suppliers to the public in December 1990. Six months later, it had sold 60% each of National Power PLC and Powergen PLC, giving to those two companies almost all the coal-fired power plants in England and Wales. The sale of nuclear generator British Energy PLC followed in 1996. Managers across the sector started cutting cut costs agressively, especially for labor. With privatization, the design of new plants was increasingly influenced by economic factors, such as natural gas's cost advantage over coal, rather than political ones. Back in 1988, Britain's old Central Electricity Generating Board had wanted to build expensive new coal plants and nuclear reactors despite the presence of vast untapped natural-gas reserves right on the U.K.'s doorstep in the North Sea. But, thanks to privatization, almost all the new power plants built in the next 10 years were gas-fired. In fact, so many were built that the government slapped a moratorium on new plants in order to cushion, if not stop, the decline of the domestic coal industry. The moratorium was lifted last November. In the early 1990s, a model evolved in which the companies that distributed power to homes and businesses -- known as regional suppliers -- were allowed to charge a specified amount for getting the power to the customer; if a company could find a way to do it for less, it got to pocket most of the difference. Customers got lower bills, and the companies' shareholders were happy -- a little too happy, in fact, as the public started to resent the ""fat cat"" bosses who were seen as skimming off fat profits for little improvement in service. Deregulation really got going in 1994, when the government allowed industry to shop around for its power. A year later it gave up its rights to veto foreign takeovers of suppliers, starting a wave of U.S.-led takeovers. But within a few years most of the U.S. firms had either sold or said they intended to, although Dallas's TXU Corp. stayed and thrived. For much of the 1990s, it wasn't market forces that brought British electricity prices down. ""Almost all of the cuts in prices to consumers came from [our] price controls on monopolies,"" says Steve Smith, head of trading arrangements at the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, the regulator that has implemented government policy under one name or another since 1990. Most of a household's bill comes from the cost of running the distribution network, not from producing the power. It was this distribution part of the business that bore the brunt of the price controls. The failure to bring down the price of power itself threatened to provoke a crisis in 1998, when the government finally extended competition to the household and small-business sectors. Nine years after the Electricity Act got the ball rolling, the market for customers was 100% open. But something still had to be done about the power generators' prices, which weren't falling as expected. In theory, British power generators had had to bid into a wholesale pool each day since 1990, telling the National Grid at what price each plant could supply power. The Grid would then buy as much power as needed from each plant, starting with the cheapest. But the pool didn't work. There were too few players in it. The generators' prices to resellers -- the regional suppliers -- stayed stubbornly flat. Accusations of market manipulation abounded, but could rarely be made to stick. The answer was NETA -- the New Electricity Trading Arrangements, which were the centerpiece of last year's Utilities Act. Under the new rules, which took effect March 27, electricity has become as close as it is ever likely to be to being a market like any other. Producers, consumers and intermediaries now all trade electricity directly with each other, up to 3 1/2 hours before they have to deliver or use it -- rather than buying power through an intermediary pool that buys from the generators. The grid operator still manages the physical flow of electricity, but intrudes only inasmuch as buyers and sellers have to notify it how much they intend to put into or take out of the grid at each half-hour of the day. NETA has galvanized competition. Prices for electricity have fallen 15% since March, according to British regulator Ofgem, and they continue to fall. But it's not a question of forcing prices down -- more of allowing the market to set the price of power. More than 7.8 million customers have switched suppliers since 1998. And the Electricity Association, a trade group for companies in the electricity business, reckons that households can cut almost GBP 30 ($43), or about 12%, off their annual bills by switching. At last, deregulation is working. ""NETA has definitely been the right framework to foster competition,"" says Brian Count, the new chief executive of Innogy PLC, a power generator and supplier that is one of two companies created last year by the breakup of the generation company National Power. But even as the free-marketers lean back and congratulate themselves on a job well done, storm clouds gather on the horizon. The Labour government, re-elected in June, has ordered the U.K.'s first national energy policy review in 20 years. The government is signaling that it wants more control over future investment decisions. The nuclear industry and renewable sources such as wind power look likely to benefit as the British government tries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. As Britain's own natural-gas reserves run out in the middle of this decade, it will become like the rest of Europe -- uneasily dependent on countries such as Algeria and Russia for supplies. Hence the support for nuclear power. The industry accepts all this, but Innogy's Mr. Count speaks for many when he says: ""For goodness' sake, don't let us now get dragged back to central planning and regulation."" --- Mr. Smith is an assistant news editor for Dow Jones Newswires in London.

Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- On Second Thought: In the wake of California's power problems, many states are taking a wait-and-see approach to deregulation By Eileen O'Grady 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California's energy crisis has a lot of people wondering whether it's really such a good idea to let consumers shop for electricity. No one wants to repeat California's mistakes. So, while 12 states and the District of Columbia already offer residential and commercial energy consumers a choice of providers, and a handful are pressing ahead with plans to fully deregulate next year, some 20 others are either delaying deregulation plans or taking a hard look at whether they ought to move toward competition. And no state has started a new deregulation effort since California's blackouts and price spikes were first reported. But while the fervor for deregulation definitely has cooled, not all of the blame can be laid at California's doorstep. Indeed, in virtually all of the states that deregulated before California's troubles began -- particularly in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Jersey -- consumers have seen for themselves that many of the new entries in the power market haven't delivered on one of the new system's key promises: lower prices. Texas, Michigan and Virginia are expected to stick to their plans to open their electricity markets fully next year. But industry sources agree that a lot more states would be about to do the same if California's electricity troubles hadn't given them second thoughts. ""The advance of retail competition has definitely stalled,"" says Ken Rose, a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute, at Ohio State University in Columbus, a research arm of a national trade group for state utility regulators. ""The question is whether it reverses,"" Mr. Rose adds. ""You would expect bumps in the road, maybe a slow start, but for the past year and a half it's not been going in the right direction."" While no state has repealed an electricity-deregulation law in the wake of California's troubles, seven states have altered their deregulation laws, mostly to delay the start of consumer choice by a few months or a few years -- until state regulators and legislators can see how deregulation plays out elsewhere. Oklahoma, one of those states, pushed its shopping start date back to 2004 or later, from July 1, 2002, worried that deregulation might jeopardize its below-average electric rates. ""California has slowed down the restructuring effort, but hasn't stopped it,"" says Oklahoma state Sen. Kevin Easley, a Democrat and an early supporter of deregulation. ""Long term, we think it's still a positive thing for Oklahoma."" As a major producer of natural gas, Oklahoma has attracted a large number of new power plants that run on natural gas. Deregulation, its local supporters say, thus could help the state create new jobs by encouraging more local power plants that export electricity, adding value to the state's natural resources. Nevada, where electricity demand is growing dramatically, used an emergency measure in April to delay the start of consumer choice for a third time. The measure also froze electricity rates until early next year and placed a moratorium on utility sales of power-generating plants. That effectively undid a customer-choice law passed in 1997, although the state will allow some large customers to shop for power next year. Wisconsin has no deregulation law, but its utilities were beginning to propose ways to divide their power-generation assets in order to create a competitive market. When California's problems emerged, however, Wisconsin Public Service Corp., a unit of WPS Resources Corp., Green Bay, withdrew a proposal that would have urged state regulators to allow the company to transfer some of its power plants to a separate company -- a first step toward deregulation. ""Wisconsin has been set back by California,"" says Larry Weyers, chairman of Wisconsin Public Service. ""Any talk of deregulation is met with a lot of opposition, and anything seen as changing the system is dead on arrival. Our plan could have been successful, but attitudes became cautious."" So much for the states that got cold feet. How are the pioneers faring? Not very well. Most electricity customers in fully deregulated states have seen few competitive options. Figures from regulators indicate that after an initial burst of consumer interest, new energy providers in New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have seen significant reductions in numbers of customers. When New Jersey started letting consumers shop in 1999, about 2.2% of residential consumers switched to a new provider. Now, only 1.1% are still buying electricity from a company other than their incumbent utility. Even Pennsylvania, which was seen as the biggest deregulation success, ""is beginning to look more ordinary,"" says Mr. Rose, the regulatory economist. Some electricity retailers that pulled out of the state blamed a climate of fear arising from California's troubles. But rising wholesale power prices have taken their toll as well, says state consumer advocate Irwin Popowsky. In 1998, Pennsylvania residential customers had a choice of at least 30 alternative power providers. Today there are fewer than 10. The reason: The new entries proved unable to compete with the lower, capped rates offered by the incumbent utilities, industry sources say. Initially, Pennsylvania's biggest utility, Peco Energy Co., a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corp., lost 44% of its industrial customers and 30% of its commercial clients to new suppliers, according to data published by the state consumer advocate's office in July 2000. One year later, however, many of those customers had returned to Peco, leaving the utility with a loss of only 4.7% of its industrial customers and 5% of its commercial clients. For residential power customers, the story's the same: Around the state, initially about 10% selected a new supplier before California's problems erupted. Today six of the state's seven original power companies have regained residential customers as competing suppliers leave the market and savings offered by those remaining shrink, Mr. Popowsky says. The number of residential customers being served by new suppliers dropped to 574,661 as of late June 2001, down 18% from March. ""It's a price issue,"" says Sharon Reishus, associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Cambridge, Mass. Though wholesale power prices have fallen since the first part of the year, they remain unpredictable, she says. A competing provider might be able to make profits, say, 10 months of the year, but could still ""get killed in the spot market"" if prices spike, Ms. Reishus says. One of the biggest new competitors in Pennsylvania is New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings Inc., Purchase, N.Y. New Power bid for and won 250,000 Peco Energy customers around the time of Peco's 1999 merger with Unicom Corp. to become Exelon. But New Power's plans extend well beyond the borders of Pennsylvania. It has plans to sell natural gas and electricity to residential consumers and businesses around the U.S. ""We have seen some volatility in the Pennsylvania market due to the rise in wholesale prices,"" says H. Eugene Lockhart, president and chief executive officer of New Power. But, he adds, ""we remain committed to serving our customers there and hope to step up our marketing efforts in the near future."" But Houston-based Shell Energy Services, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., cited the slowing pace of retail access around the country for its recent decision to drop out of the hunt for new electric customers in Texas and Ohio -- even before markets in those states are fully open. Shell Energy Services had already signed up 40,000 residential customers in Texas and 30,000 in Ohio, but officials said that, given the slow progress of deregulation, it was unlikely the company would reach the size needed to be profitable in a reasonable length of time. The prospects for selling power to residential customers remain difficult, but the opportunity for marketing to business is brighter. Small businesses are seen as key for electricity suppliers seeking new customers, says Scott Gahn, managing director of commodity management at Enron Corp.'s Enron Energy Services unit, which markets power to business. ""Each month that goes by, we're adding gas and power customers in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio and Texas,"" Mr. Gahn says. He even goes so far as to say that California's impact on deregulation hasn't been all bad. For energy markets in many states, he says, the California crisis ""has gotten the issue [of being able to choose your own provider] onto their radar screen in a way that you'd have to pay an advertising agency to do."" State officials in Texas, Michigan and Virginia, where consumers will start shopping next year, vow not to repeat California's mistakes. ""Everyone asks me, will we have California's problems?"" says Tom Noel, chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which runs the state's power grid. ""No, we won't have their problems, but we will have some of our own."" The Texas electricity market is very different from that of California. Texas has a copious supply of electricity, thanks to extensive construction of power plants powered by natural gas, which also is in plentiful supply locally. One reason California got into trouble: Its utilities had to import a lot of electricity and high-priced natural gas to meet the state's growing demand for power. Texas has attracted about two dozen companies to compete for consumers' business through a 1999 deregulation law that carved existing utilities into separate generating, transmission and retail units. It has been running a customer-choice pilot program ahead of its Jan. 1, 2002, debut of full deregulation. ""We're in this for the long haul,"" says New Power's Mr. Lockhart. ""With the opening of the market in Texas, there will be a national example of getting it right -- saving consumers money and giving them choices to help manage their energy use."" --- Ms. O'Grady is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in Houston.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C German Deal for U.S. Water Utility By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 09/17/2001 The New York Times Page 6, Column 3 c. 2001 New York Times Company In the first deal in the United States since the terrorist attacks of last week, American Water Works of Voorhees, N.J., has agreed to be sold to RWE, a German utility, for more than $5 billion, executives close to the transaction said yesterday. The deal, which is expected to be announced today before the markets open, will be a crucial test of investor confidence in mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the calamity. One executive said the transaction was being announced now partly as an effort to demonstrate the resolve of businesses worldwide. ''We discussed holding off for obvious reasons,'' the executive said. ''But we decided that we should press ahead. The markets need to know that business will continue as usual. And by that, I mean business -- the commerce of life -- will not stop in the face of terrorism.'' For RWE, the deal represents its latest effort to expand through acquisitions. Last year, RWE acquired Thames Water of Britain and the E'town Corporation of New Jersey. American Water Works, the largest publicly traded water utility in the nation, with annual revenue of $1.4 billion, has been acquisitive itself. It recently announced an agreement to buy the Azurix North America Corporation, the water utility of the Enron Corporation, and is about to complete a deal to buy the water assets of the Citizens Communications Company of Stamford, Conn. Spokesmen for American Water Works and RWE could not be reached for comment last night. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Germany's RWE Agrees to Buy American Water Works for $4.6 Billion Plus Debt 09/17/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) ESSEN, Germany -- German utility RWE AG said it has agreed to buy American Water Works Co., the largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S., for $4.6 billion, plus $3 billion in debt, in attempt to expand internationally. RWE said it would offer $46 per outstanding share of American Water Works, a 37% premium to American Water Works' share price in the past 30 days. The offer values American Water Works (AWK) at a total $7.6 billion, as RWE will offer $4.6 billion for the shares and assume $3 billion in debt, it said. Discussions between RWE and American Water had broken down late last month. When the transaction is complete, RWE plans to bundle American Water Works, which has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion, with its Thames Water operations in the U.K., RWE said. RWE is looking to expand internationally to close the gap with competing global utility firms Vivendi SA and Suez SA, both larger in size by market capitalization. Last year, RWE bought Thames Water PLC of Britain and also acquired E'town Corp. of New Jersey. American Water Works, Voorhees, N.J., is an aggressive buyer in its own right. It recently announced the purchase of Azurix North America Corp., the North American water-services division of Houston's Enron Corp. for $141.5 million, including $8.3 million of debt and tax savings of $13 million, for an enterprise value of $136.8 million. It scrapped a planned acquisition of water utility SJW Corp., San Jose, California, earlier this year after repeated regulatory delays. And it is expected to complete soon a nearly two-year-old deal to buy the water and waste-water assets of Citizens Communications Co., Stamford, Connecticut. RWE said shareholders representing 24% of American Water shares have already entered binding agreements to support the transaction. ""In addition to providing us with a top position in the U.S., the acquisition of American Water will further establish RWE as a global leader in the position of water services,"" RWE Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt said in a statement. ""The development of RWE's world-class water business in turn will provide greater balance to our core utility portfolio and allow us to deliver enhanced growth and shareholder value,"" he added. The deal is expected to be completed within 18 months to two years. The transaction will require shareholder and cartel authority approval. RWE's supervisory board and the board of American Water Works have approved the offer. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BOMBAY, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Co said on Monday it has sought urgent funding from its foreign lenders to repay interest on past loans and preserve a $2.9 billion power plant that is lying idle. Dabhol, which is 65 percent owned by Houston-based Enron, said monthly interest payments to its lenders have to be made in September but it does not have enough cash. It has about 25 foreign lenders, which include ABN AMRO, Citibank, US Exim and Bank of America. ""The company has funds in its account to make certain payments and anticipates that some of those will be made. It has requested disbursement from banks towards the rest,"" the spokesman told Reuters. He did not disclose details of the interest payments nor the cash it wants. The project has been funded 70 percent by debt. Dabhol has not been earning any income after its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), in May stopped buying any more power from its plant citing high tariffs. MSEB was buying the entire output from the plant's first phase of 740 MW and had committed to buy the second phase output of 1,444 MW when it was ready. Following the cancellation, foreign and local lenders stopped disbursals of around $400 million forcing complete stoppage of work on the second phase. They have also declined to provide funds to preserve expensive equipment from being damaged by natural elements. ""Without funds for preserving the facility, the physical assets will begin to deteriorate almost immediately, which in turn will further add to the overall cost of completion,"" the spokesman added. Dabhol now wants at least a portion of this $400 million amount disbursed to help it meet its interest payments and take care of the plant. The development is likely to put further pressure on India's federal government to solve the contentious dispute which has affected the country's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector. Three foreign power companies have already pulled out, including French giant Electricite de France . Analysts believe that a quick solution to the problem is key to restoring investor confidence. UGLY SPAT Once considered the showpiece of India's liberalisation programme, the Dabhol project is now being dubbed an example of political and bureaucratic bungling. Enron has announced its decision to sell its equity in the project to the federal government or any other company. It says MSEB is yet to pay bills worth $185 million. On Monday, Dabhol further upped the ante by slapping MSEB with two preliminary notices of termination. One is for not paying bills for the months of June and July and the other for MSEB's decision in May to cancel the power purchase agreement, the contract that governs the state board's purchase of power from Dabhol. This is the third such notice from Dabhol. In May, it served the first notice for non-payment of bills for December and January. The two fresh notices are a body blow for MSEB, analysts said as it means the state utility could end up fighting three separate arbitration battles. According to the power purchase agreement, all disputes will have to be settled by the International Court of Arbitration in London. As per this agreement, serving preliminary notice is followed by a six-month cooling off period. If the dispute is not settled by then, Dabhol can issue a final notice and the dispute automatically goes for arbitration. The six-month period for the first notice, which was issued in May, ends in November. If there is no settlement by then, MSEB will have to answer Dabhol's charges of non-payment of bills for December and January. The same procedure will be followed in the case of the other two notices. But efforts to solve the issue so far through arbitration have been delayed by domestic litigation. MSEB wants the dispute to be heard by local courts, while Dabhol is pressing for arbitration in London. The Bombay high court, which began hearing this dispute on Monday, is expected to give a final verdict soon. ($1=48.83 Indian rupees). Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: INTERVIEW-Screen trading enhances metals market. By Martin Hayes 09/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The emergence of electronic screen systems alongside existing open-outcry and telephone markets has enhanced trading in base metals, Paul Shuman, LME desk manager at Cargill Investor Services (CIS), said. ""From our perspective, because we are brokers and do not run a proprietary position, we are bound, and always will be, to try and get the best price for our customers. The more platforms there are for us to trade on, the better for our customers,"" Shuman told Reuters. The London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's leading non-ferrous metals market, introduced an automated trading system (ATS) known as Select in February, and unveiled a more sophisticated phase last week. The LME's system joined rival platforms managed by Spectron Metals and Enron Online, part of Enron Corp. These systems have improved market liquidity and increased price transparency throughout the day, Shuman said. ""Instead of being restricted to the ring and the telephone market, where you have to ring around, you have instant access to bids and offers all through the day."" ""Now when we give our customers a market we can do that on the basis of the best bid and offer on the screen. From our company's perspective it has been very helpful,"" he said. Spreads between bids and offers have narrowed and access to the market has become faster. ""It is certainly a tighter market, a quicker market, and probably a more liquid market, he said. SCREENS NOT PARAMOUNT However, the LME's ATS is not designed to replace open-outcry on the 124-year-old exchange. Rather, it will complement the current mix of inter-office phone trading and open-outcry. ""Screens do not replace the ability to talk to one another,"" he said. There are instances when customers needs to transact a highly complex, multi-legged carry or spread trade, and it is unlikely that any system will be able to replicate that. ""You phone up another broker and say what you want to do. You either have to do it face-to-face or on the phone - you cannot do it on the screen - speed is important."" He said there may well be a fall-off in volume at one or other of the current platforms, but the screens and the telephone market are likely to run in tandem, while the LME plans to continue open-outcry ring trading as well. ""For the customers, they are going to get the best of all worlds,"" he added. LME SCREENS GAINING ACCEPTANCE On the screens the dust has still to settle between the rivals, but there are signs that LME Select is being used more by the market. ""In the last few weeks, Select has done better as more people have become used to it, and it (Select) is free, whereas some others are not,"" Shuman said. And now the Select system is much more capable after the release of the second, more sophisticated phase. ""It is very ambitious and it will be interesting to see how it works,"" he said. The second release incorporates a unique request-for-quote function. This allows traders to direct enquiries, such as market size and depth, to as many or as few respondents as required, and whether or not to be anonymous. It also covers all the LME's contracts - the initial release was confined to the basic cash, three months and cash-to-threes spread contracts. ""It is going to take a while for Select Two to become the tool for the industry. But Cargill is in favour of anything that allows us to give a better service to our customers,"" Shuman said.

French Electricity Bourse To Run Tests Before Launch 09/17/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French electricity bourse, Powernext SA took one step closer to its imminent launch with the announcement Monday that it will host a series of simulations from Sept. 25. Powernext will stage three sets of simulations, the first from Sept. 25 to Sept. 27, the second on Oct. 2-4, and the third on Oct. 9-11, Powernext said in a press statement. Close to 20 companies will participate in the tests, including electricity suppliers, traders, the exchange's investors, industrial consumers and traders. TXU Europe Energy Trading and Enron will be among the participants. The exchange is also holding seminars this week for participants to get acquainted with the ElWeb electronic trading system, also currently used by Nord Pool in the Nordic region, the market model, and Clearnet, the exchange's financial guarantor. Jean-Francois Conil-Lacoste, Powernext's director-general, said the exchange is still on track for its official launch later this autumn, although a date hasn't been set yet. Euronext Paris SA and HGRT, a financial holding for European electricity grid operators, hold 34% and 17% of Powernext, respectively. Currently, Electricite de France (F.EDF) is the sole shareholder in HGRT, although the long-range plan envisions Dutch grid operator, TenneT and Belgian counterpart, Elia as potential investors. Powernext aims to expand its activities in the Benelux region, dovetailing newly created Euronext, formed through a merger of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges. Powernext will also announce later this autumn the addition of new investors. Currently, the remaining 49% is divvied up among French banks BNP Paribas (F.BNP), and Societe Generale (F.SGF), plus state-owned EDF, oil giant TotalFinaElf (TOT) and Belgian utility Electrabel (B.ELE), which each hold 9.8%. These stakes will fall to 5.0% with the entry of the new investors, the threshold necessary to hold one seat on the board of directors. The exchange plans to initially offer physical electricity in hourly blocks for delivery the next day. Separately, EDF Trading, the London-based trading joint venture of EDF with commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, will start trading in the French wholesale market Oct. 1., EDF's Director of Client Services, Loic Caperan, said last week. EDF Trading is barred by the European Union Competition Authority from trading in the French retail market. The trading arm isn't allowed to assist EDF to structure contracts for France's energy-intensive industrial consumers, the group eligible to choose suppliers representing about one-third of domestic power consumption. But the entry of EDF Trading into the wholesale market is viewed by some traders as crucial to injecting necessary liquidity for electricity trading to flourish in France. The pace of power market deregulation is slowly starting to pick up in France. Powernext is the second project to launch this autumn aimed at kick-starting trading. Last week, EDF auctioned options on close to 1,200 megawatts of local power production. As the E.U.'s second-largest power market, which shares its borders with five countries and is connected to the U.K. via an under-water electricity interconnector, France is key to the eventual formation of a pan-European traded market. -By Sarah Wachter, Dow Jones Newswires; 331-4017-1740; sarah.wachter@dowjones.com -0- 17/09/01 09-56G Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) 2001-09-17 07:02 (New York) RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) (Adds where American Water is based in second paragraph, moves stock drop to seventh, adds context in third paragraph.) Essen, Germany, Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- RWE AG, Europe's No. 4 power company, agreed to buy American Water Works Inc., the biggest publicly traded U.S. water utility, for $7.6 billion in cash and assumed debt in a bid to catch up with larger rivals. RWE is offering $46 in cash per share, 35 percent more than last Monday's close, for the Vorhees, New Jersey-based company. Germany's RWE will assume $3 billion of American Water's debt, said Chief Financial Officer Klaus Sturany on a conference call. The purchase will add more than 10 million U.S. customers to RWE's water unit and further reduce its reliance on the German electricity market. It will also help RWE narrow the gap to Suez SA and Vivendi Environnement SA a year after Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt spent $9.8 billion on Thames Water Plc of the U.K. ``RWE has said it wants to expand in water, and this is another step in that direction,'' said Ulf Moritzen, who helps manage 100 million euros ($93 million) at Nordinvest. ``In the current situation, it makes sense to buy a defensive business.'' The planned purchase isn't cheap. Including debt, RWE will pay about 5.4 times sales for the U.S. company, compared with 4.9 times sales for Thames Water. In the U.S., buyers paid about 4 times sales for the 15-plus takeovers in the country's water industry over the past two years, according to Bloomberg data. Stock Drops Including pending acquisitions by the U.S. company, the price will rise to about $8.4 billion by closing, said Sturany. RWE will sell an unspecified amount of new bonds to finance the purchase, he said, without giving a time frame. RWE shares fell as much as 2.27 euros, or 5.5 percent, to 38.90 euros in Frankfurt. They've declined 17 percent this year. American Water shares closed at $34.12 last Monday, the last day U.S. markets were open before the terrorist attacks. The acquisition is the biggest announced since terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last Tuesday. Sturany said the companies reached an agreement last week, though they decided to delay the announcement because of the disaster. ``We have enormous confidence in the U.S. economy,'' Sturany said. ``Despite the enormity of the events, we expect the U.S. market to prevail.'' He said the contract with American Water doesn't include any special clauses related to the attack. After the purchase, which may take as long as two years to complete, the Essen, Germany-based company will have 56 million water customers worldwide, according to spokesman Bill McAndrews. Suez and Vivendi each serve more than 100 million people. More Purchases Sturany said American Water, which will become a unit of Thames Water, will expand further in the U.S. by using the German company's ``strong balance sheet.'' The Thames Water purchase last year gave RWE New Jersey-based utility E'town Corp. RWE said the new acquisition will make it the largest water company in the U.S., the world's biggest single market. American Water has customers in 23 U.S. states, the German company said. The U.S. market, with more than 54,000 local utilities, is ``ripe'' for consolidation, he said. RWE today said the latest purchase will help boost earnings before goodwill in the first year after completion. The company had sales of $1.35 billion last year and employs 5,000 people throughout the U.S. RWE's total debt will rise to about 8 billion euros ($7.4 billion) after the purchase, Sturany said. RWE's debt-to- equity ratio was about 2.8 before the purchase compared with 41 times for Vivendi Environnement, according to Bloomberg data. The yield on RWE's outstanding 6.5 percent 20-year bond rose 0.1659, or 0.2 percent, to 100.0455 after the announcement. RWE in April sold 3.46 billion euros worth of bonds to help pay for Thames Water, including 350 million pounds in 20-year bonds. RWE has an ``Aa3'' rating from Moodys' Investors Service and a ``AA-'' rating from rival agency Standard & Poor's. Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter advised RWE on the U.S. purchase. Goldman Sachs advised American Water. RWE said 24 percent of American Water's shareholders are already backing its takeover offer, which has also been approved by the German and the U.S. companies boards of directors. Enron India Unit Serves Second Notice to Cancel Power Contract 2001-09-17 08:50 (New York) Mumbai, Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Dabhol Power Co., Enron Corp.'s Indian unit, said it has served a second notice on the state-owned Maharashtra State Electricity Board stating that it will start proceedings to cancel its power supply contract because its waiting to be paid past dues. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co., which runs the $3 billion power plant, India's biggest foreign investment. It is owed $64 million by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer, in unpaid bills for 9 months. The board in May stopped buying power, saying it's too expensive. ``Little progress has so far been made on reaching a fair and reasonable solution'' to the payments dispute, the company said in a statement. Enron on May 19 issued the first notice to cancel the power supply contract with the board.

The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov. I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable. For example, the summary says: ""Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation. (...) But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved."" ""The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to."" ""Even without restructuring, California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000."" ""Consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market."" ""Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market."" On the negative side, the report summary does state that ""some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more"" and ""the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices.""",important

It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton. They requested the report be updated. A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page. I read the summary and will read the balance. So far, so good. It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged. However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers. The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets. The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying ""And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.""",important

 PRODUCT","Steffes, James D. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JSTEFFE>",dasovich-j,"Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E). I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC ""overpayment"". Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC ""overpayment""? On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the ""overpayment"" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.

Subject: RE: PG&E PX Credit Calculation -- CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT After 3/31/02, the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit, no? So a customer's CTC payments should not be affected by refunds. If refunds are distributed prospectively, we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PG&E's expected refunds, divide it by total load, and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount.

I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs. I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check. On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct. PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC. All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"". If I am right, that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or ""Est RT$"" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes -----Original Message----- From: Steffes, James D.

Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee= ,=20 heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that quizzed the FERC=20 commissioners and Davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic Western=20 electricity market. ?????Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged=20 price-gouging by out-of-state generators. ?????""To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to=20 Californians,"" Davis said. ""It is unconscionable for the generators to prof= it=20 from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law= =20 and order the energy companies to give back the money."" ?????Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.=20 California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,=20 power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitiv= e=20 market would warrant, he said. ?????California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a seri= es=20 of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economi= c=20 slowdown since the power crisis began last year. ?????The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate= =20 whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or=20 exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators= =20 deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply=20 shortages. ?????Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded ""price mitigation""= =20 program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price=20 limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had= =20 previously applied only to California during emergency power outages. ?????Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a=20 legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,= =20 California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on= a=20 package of energy amendments, including a price cap. ?????The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,=20 contending they would discourage more power production. ?????Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that=20 supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not hel= p,=20 California. ?????The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts= =20 this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at= =20 $150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would= =20 shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on producti= on=20 costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of= =20 capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study. ?????However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some= =20 kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the=20 congressional elections next year. ?????The FERC plan expands an existing ""price mitigation"" program in=20 California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through Septemb= er=20 2002, means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power= =20 cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a Stage 1= =20 power shortage emergency in California. ?????A Stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7= =20 percent of demand on the Western power grid. ?????The plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into= =20 California as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the= =20 state's financially weak utilities. ?????Davis was due to meet the two newest FERC commissioners, Patrick Wood = of=20 Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, today.

As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale= =20 generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into=20 recession.=20 ?????The FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and= =20 natural gas shortages.=20 ?????Let's look at what the FERC did right. First, the order approved Monda= y=20 establishes price caps on a 24/7 basis rather than simply during power=20 emergencies--a long overdue reform.=20 ?????Second, the order protects the entire West, not just California. This= =20 regional cap will end ""megawatt laundering,"" whereby in-state generators so= ld=20 power across California lines and then resold it back into the state to eva= de=20 caps.=20 ?????Third, the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the= =20 FERC's previous price caps Swiss cheese. Before, generators could redirect= =20 their sales from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the pric= e=20 caps.=20 ?????So where did the FERC go wrong? The problem may be traced to the two= =20 competing methods of imposing price caps and the all-important concept of= =20 ""economic rent.""=20 ?????Economic rent, in the wholesale electricity market, is the market pric= e=20 of electricity minus the producer's cost, where cost includes not just labo= r=20 and fuel but a ""fair profit"" on the invested capital as well. In traditiona= l=20 regulation, this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost o= f=20 the money borrowed to build the power plant.=20 ?????Under this definition, if the producer's cost is a nickel a kilowatt= =20 hour and he can sell it for 35 cents--as producers in the West have been=20 doing--the producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers.= =20 ?????In California, the extraction of such economic rent through market=20 manipulation has taken place on a grand-theft scale. In 1999, California's= =20 electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it was almost $30 billion= =20 for roughly the same amount of electricity. This year, California's bill is= =20 well on its way to $50 billion annually.=20 ?????To stop this rip-off, Gov. Gray Davis proposed ""cost-based"" price caps= .=20 Such caps are calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allow= ed=20 to recover its cost of production, including the fair profit, but not a pen= ny=20 more.=20 ?????Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at= a=20 nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel. The oldest, least efficien= t=20 plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cent= s.=20 ?????By setting different prices for different plants, the economic rents a= re=20 driven to zero. Yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to=20 produce. From a public policy perspective, it's the best of all possible=20 worlds. And it was categorically rejected by the FERC. Instead, the FERC se= ts=20 a single price for all generators based on the cost of the ""least efficient= =20 plant.""=20 ?????The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still= =20 allows generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers.=20 ?????In our previous example, and under the FERC's rule, the least efficien= t=20 plant still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs. However, the most=20 efficient plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt also collects 20= =20 cents rather than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic=20 rent.=20 ?????Thus, under the FERC's rule, wholesale generators still will be able t= o=20 capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than= =20 under Davis' cost-based rule.=20 ?????The FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic=20 gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure th= at=20 during peak times, when the price cap is being established, the most=20 expensive possible plant is in operation--whether it needs to be or not. Th= is=20 will peg the price at the highest level.=20 ?????In addition, the FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to= =20 run their least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient=20 plants are also the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air.=20 Moreover, the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on=20 already stretched natural gas supplies.

Depending on the=20 available snowpack, hydroelectricity produced at more than 200 dams in the= =20 Columbia River basin generates between 60 and 75 percent of the region's=20 electricity.

The second is the= =20 dams' negative impact on salmon. These dams operate under a federal salmon= =20 recovery plan established under the Endangered Species Act that calls for= =20 more water to be sent over spillways to help push the salmon downstream=20 instead of through the dams' power-generating turbines.=20 That power is sold at cost and transmitted to Northwest consumer-owned=20 utilities by yet another federal agency called the Bonneville Power=20 Administration. These ""cost-based"" rates cover the expense of repaying the= =20 U.S.=20 Treasury for the cost of developing these hydropower projects, moving the= =20 power over massive transmission lines, and supporting efforts to restore th= e=20 dwindling salmon runs.=20 Under federal law, Northwest consumers get preferred access to the relative= ly=20 low-cost power. Any surplus power can be sold, most often to California's= =20 municipal and investor-owned utilities.=20 This Northwest ""regional preference"" to federal power was part of the deal= =20 that led to the construction of the massive transmission lines, called ""the= =20 intertie,"" which first connected the Northwest with California and the=20 Southwest in the late 1960s.=20 For decades, the intertie worked almost flawlessly and to everyone's benefi= t.=20 During the summer, when air conditioners caused California's power use to= =20 peak, many California utilities would supplement their needs by turning to= =20 the Northwest.

This is a case where= =20 the third time is unlikely to be a charm.=20 As chairman of the Market Surveillance Committee of the California=20 Independent System Operator, the independent committee formed by FERC to=20 monitor the California market, I have analyzed the results of FERC's previo= us=20 attempts. They reveal a misunderstanding of important details of the=20 California electricity market. It is therefore not surprising that they hav= e=20 been ineffective.=20 Starting in November of 2000, FERC acknowledged that wholesale prices in=20 California during the summer of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable. Its=20 December 2000 order implemented the first set of remedies. Both the=20 California Power Exchange Market Monitoring Committee and the committee I= =20 chair pointed out important shortcomings in FERC's analysis of the Californ= ia=20 market and argued that its remedies would most likely harm, rather than=20 enhance, market performance.=20 At this time, FERC also did not order refunds for the unjust and unreasonab= le=20 prices, even though it acknowledged the prices reflected the exercise of=20 market power, which is the ability of a producer to force prices higher. Th= e=20 Federal Power Act requires refunds under these circumstances. But FERC said= =20 it was unable to find specific instances of firms exercising market power.= =20 This makes no sense. If FERC finds that prices indicate market power, then= =20 the generators who bid those prices are exercising market power.=20 Following the implementation of these remedies, conditions in the Californi= a=20 market deteriorated far beyond what had been predicted by the two market=20 monitoring committees. Even though January and February are the lowest dema= nd=20 months of the year, average wholesale electricity prices were almost 10 tim= es=20 higher in 2001 than they were during the same two months of 2000 and almost= =20 double the average price during the summer of 2000. In January, March and= =20 May, California experienced several days of rolling blackouts and had syste= m=20 emergencies almost every day during January and February of 2001.=20 IN April, FERC made another round of market rule changes designed to lead t= o=20 just and reasonable prices. However, in response to growing pressure from= =20 Congress, less than 10 days after these remedies were implemented, FERC=20 enacted its most recent order.=20 Before Congress declares victory, it should verify that FERC's most recent= =20 plan achieves the following two goals.=20 First, the plan should guarantee that the average price of wholesale=20 electricity paid by California over the next two years is equal to the=20 average price that would occur in a competitive electricity market, with=20 California's current supply and demand conditions and fuel costs. The Feder= al=20 Power Act requires not just a high probability of just and reasonable rates= ;=20 it requires that they occur with certainty.=20 The second goal is to alter the incentives faced by all market participants= =20 so that it will no longer be profit-maximizing for a firm to withhold=20 electricity from the market in order to drive up prices.=20 FERC's most recently implemented plan does not achieve either of these goal= s,=20 although it does come closer than any previous attempts.=20 One solution satisfying both of these goals has been proposed to FERC. In a= =20 December report to FERC, the Market Surveillance Committee of the Californi= a=20 ISO proposed a one-time regulatory intervention. This intervention would=20 require that each generator serving California sign a forward contract=20 guaranteeing that California consumers can purchase 75 percent of the=20 generator's expected output over the next two years at a specified=20 competitive benchmark price. Once a firm has signed these forward contracts= ,=20 it is free to sell all remaining energy in the western U.S. wholesale marke= t=20 at whatever price it can obtain.=20 The obligation to provide power under the contracts, and the incentive to= =20 sell 25 percent of power at unrestricted prices, would prevent generators= =20 from withholding power.=20 Unless FERC implements a solution satisfying these two goals, Congress shou= ld=20 require FERC to suspend the market-based pricing authority for all supplier= s=20 in the Western U.S. for the next two years and order all sales during this= =20 period at cost-of-service prices.

''This is a market-based mitigation plan that now will extend to 11= =20 Western states.''=20 In fact, it bore some resemblance to a proposal made by 10 leading economis= ts=20 who urged a middle ground between fixed prices and a deregulated electricit= y=20 market. Mr. Davis used their proposal to support his position in favor of= =20 limited price restraints when Mr. Bush visited California .=20 The White House shift from outright opposition to price controls to its mor= e=20 nuanced position today exemplifies how Mr. Bush has tempered his embrace of= =20 completely unfettered markets in recent weeks. He didn't have much choice.= =20 As the threat of blackouts loomed, demands for action rose from officials o= f=20 both parties and from consumers in the West. It was almost possible to hear= =20 sighs of relief at the White House today that the Federal Energy Regulatory= =20 Commission -- an independent body in the Energy Department -- had moved to= =20 turn down the political heat.=20 In fact, while some House Democrats are still pressing for firmer caps on= =20 prices, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California , and Gordon H.= =20 Smith, Republican of Oregon, withdrew a bill that would have placed strict= =20 price controls on electricity sold in Western markets.=20 Senator Feinstein said the White House could call yesterday's regulatory=20 action ''mitigation'' or anything else it pleased.=20 ''A rose is a rose by any other name,'' she said today.=20 And a free market is not always free. Two weeks ago the administration said= =20 it would rescue steel companies and steelworkers who have long complained= =20 about unfair competition from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Brazil, Germany,= =20 Russia and Ukraine. The White House defended the action by saying it was th= e=20 only way for the industry to adjust to a new competitive environment.=20 Last month, with no major announcements at the White House, the Bush=20 administration voted for International Monetary Fund aid to two countries,= =20 Turkey and Argentina, that (like California ) had made some economically=20 disastrous political decisions.=20 In each case, Mr. Bush's economic orthodoxies were tempered by political=20 realities.=20 The California crisis was one thing when it involved a Democratic governor = in=20 a state Mr. Bush lost by a million votes; it was another, one of his aides= =20 conceded today, when congressional Republicans from around the West were=20 warning Mr. Bush that blackouts and sky-high prices could blow up in his=20 first year in office.=20 ''We heard from a lot of members of Congress who feared that Republicans=20 would be tarred with worsening the problem, even though it happened on Gray= =20 Davis's watch,'' the political aide said. ''The president took that on=20 board.''=20 Similarly, the steel decision was partly about enforcing laws against=20 ''dumping'' foreign products in the market -- and partly about Mr. Bush's= =20 desire to convince labor unions not to block his trade agenda. Like=20 Californians coping with higher energy prices, the steelworkers need time t= o=20 adjust to a new world, the administration said.=20 ''Open markets improve the lives of people by increasing opportunity, choic= e=20 and economic freedom,'' Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's trade representative= ,=20 said in an interview today. ''But compassionate conservatism also recognize= s=20 the reality that the effects of rapid change fall harder on some communitie= s=20 and industries,'' which, he said, need ''vital breathing space to adapt to= =20 change.''=20 While Mr. Bush expressed deep reservations about I.M.F. bailouts during the= =20 presidential campaign, the situation seemed a bit more complicated once he= =20 got to Washington. The State and Defense Departments feared that if Turkey= =20 were engulfed in economic chaos, and blamed the United States for failing t= o=20 come to its aid, its leaders might be less inclined to let American fighter= =20 jets use its territory to mount missions over Iraq.=20 So given the choice between letting the Turkish people pay a high price for= =20 political mistakes -- Californians take note -- and weakening American=20 pressure on Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush decided that economic niceties were le= ss=20 important than political consistency. Mr. Bush chose the Pentagon over the= =20 Treasury.=20 Administration officials said these actions did not represent a retreat fro= m=20 let-the-markets-prevail orthodoxy.=20 Lawrence B.

''FERC is doing its best to square that circle in the face of= =20 the fundamental problem, which is inadequate supply,'' he said.=20 That is the kind of argument that keeps economists happily arguing for hour= s.=20 It is not likely to be the kind of argument Mr. Bush himself is likely to= =20 engage in for long.

That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al= so=20 at off-hours, when no one had ever seen a price spike before, makes those= =20 spikes even more curious.=20 There is, in addition, the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20 natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., now the largest= =20 gas company on Earth, was charging on the California side of the=20 California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance= =20 between supply and demand.=20 None of that may be illegal.

Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998, AES made a bold move.

Chairman Kenneth Lay: ""I would love to=20 personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooe= d=20 dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.""'=20 ?????Here's why Lockyer should be removed from his office of public trust:= =20 First, because as the chief law enforcement officer of the largest state in= =20 the nation, he not only has admitted that rape is a regular feature of the= =20 state's prison system, but also that he considers rape a part of the=20 punishment he can inflict on others.=20 ?????Second, because he has publicly stated that he would like to personall= y=20 arrange the rape of a Texas businessman who has not even been charged with= =20 any illegal behavior.=20 ?????Lockyer's remarks reveal him to be an authoritarian thug, someone whol= ly=20 unsuited to holding an office of public trust.=20 ?????But his remarks do have one positive merit: They tell us what criminal= =20 penalties really entail.=20 ?????Contrary to some depictions of prisons as country clubs, they are=20 violent and terrible places. More and more politicians propose criminal=20 sanctions for more and more alleged misdeeds, and as a result ever more kin= ds=20 of behavior are sanctioned by criminal penalties, perhaps now even selling= =20 electricity. Those found guilty of such crimes are put into cages, where th= ey=20 are deprived of their liberty and dignity and, as Lockyer so clearly=20 acknowledged, raped and brutalized. What's worse, Lockyer has indicated tha= t=20 he believes that rape is an appropriate part of the system of punishments h= e=20 administers.=20 ?????Should it matter that Lay is a businessman? Imagine the outcry if the= =20 head of Enron were female. What would Lockyer's fellow Democrats have said = to=20 that?=20 ?????Should it matter that Lay is chairman of an electricity generator? Doe= s=20 the nature of his business justify threats to escort him to his own rape?= =20 Lockyer told the Los Angeles Times that he had singled out Enron's chairman= =20 because the Houston-based company is the world's largest energy trader.=20 ?????So apparently singling out a man for a heinous threat is OK because he= 's=20 the chairman of the world's largest energy trading company. That's accordin= g=20 to the man who, as a state senator, sponsored California's 1984 hate-crimes= =20 law. Evidently the crusader against intimidation on the basis of race,=20 religion and sexual orientation feels no hesitation at all about intimidati= ng=20 someone and threatening him with the brutal use of physical force simply=20 because he heads the world's largest energy trading company.=20 ?????Lockyer and Gov. Gray Davis seem to think that the best way to keep th= e=20 lights on is to threaten electricity producers with brute force, rather tha= n=20 to offer to pay competitive rates in competitive markets. Are energy=20 producers to blame for California's energy problems? No. Bad policies,=20 including rigid controls on retail prices of electricity, are the cause of= =20 the problem, not the people who generate energy. Scapegoating producers and= =20 threatening them with violence is an old ploy of authoritarians. California= ns=20 should not stand for it.=20 ?????An Enron spokesman said that Lockyer's chilling stated desire to arran= ge=20 the rape of Lay does not merit a response. The spokesman is wrong.

O.J. did--or didn't--have a bloody glove. ??Here in the Capitol, the hot dog has become an unlikely metaphor for the state's energy crisis. ??In packed news conferences and heated Assembly floor debates, lawmakers from both parties have evoked images of the ordinary dog to help explain an extraordinary mess. ??The genesis of this statehouse trend is difficult to determine. Assemblyman Fred Keeley appears to be the first to have tossed the hot dog into the political fire. ??During a crucial Assembly discussion in January, the Boulder Creek Democrat recited the lyrics to a familiar Oscar Mayer jingle as a way of admitting that a controversial bill to have the state buy electricity to avoid blackouts was unpalatable, but necessary. ??""It's the dog kids love to bite,"" said Keeley of the jingle. ""Well, this is the bill people love to hate."" ??A bizarre, partisan hot dog duel ensued. Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) responded by likening the unpredictable financial consequences of the Keeley legislation to biting recklessly into mystery meat. ??""Before I bite into it I see what's on the outside, but I can't see the inside,"" Campbell said. ""If nobody can tell me what's on the inside, it may be bitter, it may be bad, it may make me sick."" ??Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) angrily fired back, wanting to know why Campbell, a professed hot dog eater, was suddenly so critical of its unknown contents. ??""It's OK to eat a hot dog that's full of animal bones and hair,"" Migden said. ""That's a hot dog that's OK with you, but this kind of hot dog isn't."" ??Yet it was Senate leader John Burton who made it the key ingredient in a Capitol catch phrase. ??Burton described a plan to purchase the electrical power grid from the state's private utilities as a fair swap, saying: ""I give you a dollar, you give me a hot dog."" ??The sound-bite quickly took on a life of its own. With the cost of the energy crisis growing faster than the price of ballpark franks, critics doubted the public's appetite for a multibillion-dollar hot dog. ??""Do you really want a hot dog? That is the question,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group for power generators. ??Not content to let a dog lie in its bun, lawmakers such as Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) kept the hot dog in public discourse. ??When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection, Leonard was one of a chorus of legislators who questioned the merits of purchasing the remaining portion of the power lines, calling it ""not even half a hot dog."" ??Added Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park): ""It's like paying Mercedes prices for a broken down hot dog cart."" ??In recent weeks, the hot dog rhetoric appeared to have gone cold. Then Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) revived it. ??After enduring hours of testimony on details of the deal to purchase Edison's power lines, Vargas said his opinion of the dollar-equals-hot-dog deal had diminished. ??""They're trying to charge us for a hot dog,"" Vargas said of the utility, ""but it looks like we're only going to be getting a wienie."" ??Reliant Vice President John Stout also recently weighed in with his own hot dog analogy as he tried to explain why his company's income had jumped so much during the crisis. ??""If you have a hot dog stand and you go out and buy five to six more hot dog stands,"" Stout said, referring to his company's purchase of power plants, ""then naturally you would expect the operating income to go up."" ??Alas, the dog days of summer have yet to begin.

A1 LENGTH: 835 words HEADLINE: Davis asks U.S. to limit firms' prices; RATE SWINGS: Governor argues 2 generators manipulated market SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill DATELINE: Sacramento BODY: Gov. Gray Davis pursued a new strategy yesterday to control wholesale electricity costs by demanding that federal regulators ban two generators from selling power in California at market rates, arguing that they have manipulated the market to their advantage. ???Meanwhile, the Davis administration lambasted a federal plan to implement temporary price controls, scheduled to go into effect Tuesday. State officials said the measures would do nothing to tame California's out-of-control costs for electricity. ???Davis, whose calls for broader price limits on wholesale electricity have been rejected repeatedly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is scheduled to meet with President Bush next week to ask Washington to do more to help California. ???""Federal regulators said that prices were 'unjust and unreasonable' nearly nine months ago, but they have been AWOL ever since,"" Davis said in a statement. ???The California Independent System Operator, managers of the state's electrical grid, asked energy regulators yesterday to revoke the authority they have given Williams Energy and AES Inc. to sell power at market-based rates. Instead, the Davis administration wants the companies to be forced to sell at cost-plus rates, which would ensure a reasonable but limited profit. ???""Market-based rate authority is not an entitlement,"" the ISO said in a filing with federal regulators. ???The ISO asked regulators to act by June 15, saying that any delay ""places California consumers and the state's economy at extreme peril."" ???Similar filings against other companies, such as Mirant, Duke and Reliant, are being considered, said Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO. ???Robinson said the ISO has a ""well developed"" record of price manipulation by the two companies. He said information previously given to federal regulators proved the prices charged to California were excessive. ???'GRANDSTANDING' ACCUSATION ???Aaron Thomas, a spokesman for Virginia-based AES, said the administration is grandstanding. ???""This is akin to the rhetoric the governor has used for the past several months,"" he said. ""We are well below the index FERC uses to establish concerns about market power. ???""As to this rhetoric about these companies abusing the marketplace -- check the facts. We lost money last year,"" Thomas said. ???A spokeswoman for Williams said the company would not comment because it had not seen the filing. ???Earlier this month, Oklahoma-based Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle charges with FERC that the company was purposely withholding electricity from California's power market. The company admitted no wrongdoing, and officials said a full hearing would have cleared the company. ???If the regulatory commission denies the state's requests, or doesn't ""act in the time frame we believe is necessary to prevent harm,"" the state can appeal to a circuit court, Robinson said. ???BUSH VISIT POSTURING CHARGE ???Jan Smutny-Jones, head of the Independent Energy Producers Association, said the move is posturing by Davis ahead of Bush's visit. ???""This is an interesting welcome mat for President Bush,"" he said. ""Do we want a dialogue or a diatribe?"" ???In advance of Bush's visit, Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday that nothing more can be done to help solve California's power problems this summer. ???He also rejected price controls, saying that previous efforts have contributed to a supply shortage. ???A spokesman for Davis rejected that notion and denied that the timing of yesterday's announcements were connected to the Bush-Davis meeting. ???Davis aides expressed hope that Bush's two new FERC commissioners, Pat Wood III, a close Bush ally expected to take over the chairmanship of the board, and Nora Mead Brownell, a state utility regulator in Pennsylvania, would hear California's pleas. The two new commissioners were confirmed yesterday by the U.S. Senate. ???Among the things Davis wants changed is the regulatory commission temporary price relief plan scheduled to take effect Tuesday. ???The regulators would limit wholesale prices during power alerts in California, when reserves drop below 7 percent of available capacity. ???Many state officials believe that doesn't go far enough. The state Assembly, in documents to be filed Tuesday, said price controls should cover all hours -- not just power emergencies. ???And there is a chance the controls will be in effect for just a few days. Under the regulatory commission plan, the state and the three investor-owned utilities must file a proposal to join a regional transmission organization by June 1. If they do not to do so, the price controls disappear. ???Davis administration officials expect to file another response dealing with the regional transmission organization by Friday, Robinson said. The Assembly filing rejects joining such an organization, which federal officials favor as a means to better manage and improve grid capacity in the West.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL On the eve of a meeting Tuesday between President George Bush and California Gov. Gray Davis, top advisers to the governor said the state could be pushed into recession unless the federal government imposes temporary price caps to contain soaring wholesale electricity costs. President Bush has consistently opposed price caps. The governor's team called a Memorial Day news conference to highlight what they saw as the dangers to the economy of the state, and possibly the nation, from the tens of billions of dollars being spent this year to purchase electricity. The governor's aides estimated that statewide, wholesale electricity purchases this year could hit $50 billion compared with about $7 billion in 1999. Some estimates for this year's power expenditures are even higher. If California were a separate nation, ""an energy shock of that magnitude would be expected to cause a significant recession,"" said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the conference. While being part of a broader national economy could somewhat mitigate the impact, the higher power costs are ""a recipe for stagflation in California,"" added Mr. Blinder. ""Stagflation"" refers to stagnant economic conditions and inflation -- a condition that struck the nation when energy prices soared in the 1970s. Though the advisers painted perhaps the dreariest outlook yet to come from the governor's office, they said that the Davis plan for financing the state's electricity purchases remains intact. As reported, the state plans to sell about $12.5 billion in bonds later this year. The state has been purchasing electricity since January, when its failed utility-deregulation plan left California's two biggest utilities financially unable to continue buying power. If price caps were instituted, the state might have to borrow less money than anticipated or at least face a decreased danger of having to borrow more if the power situation gets worse, said Joseph Fichera, chief executive of New York-based Saber Partners LLC and an adviser to Mr. Davis. The governor plans to press his case for price caps over the next six to 18 months, as supplies are increased with new power plants due to come into operation, the advisers said. However, Mr. Bush and other federal officials have repeatedly said that they believe price caps would be counterproductive and discourage the building of new power plants. Write to John R.

April's rise marked the biggest increase since January. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity and has been a main pillar propping up the country's fragile economy. Personal incomes rose 0.3 percent. ??Bush Won't Cap Electricity Prices ??LOS ANGELES (AP) ??President Bush says he won't force down soaring electricity prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January. The Republican president and embattled Democratic Gov. Gray Davis arranged a meeting today to talk about the state's energy crisis, but there was no indication they would break their stalemate. Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy, arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of the crisis. ??Tornado Injures 18 in Colorado ??ELLICOTT, Colo.

Gray Davis, a Democrat who has waged a long-distance war with the Republican president over the high cost and short supply of electricity in the nation's most populous state. ??""I hope he has an opportunity to talk firsthand to some of the people who are adversely impacted by the very high rates we're paying for electricity."" ??But the president's carefully scrubbed schedule for the next two days provides little time for such an opportunity, although he will confer privately with business leaders to discuss high-tech solutions to the state's energy problems. ??Arriving on a cross-country flight that touched down in Arizona for a Memorial Day tribute, Bush headed off to prepare for an early-morning stop Tuesday to promote energy conservation at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton and a luncheon address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??On Wednesday, he'll visit Sequoia National Park near Fresno, Calif., to launch a new drive to clean up and fix up national parks. ??He'll also meet privately Tuesday afternoon with Davis in what the Los Angeles Times characterized as a ""peace summit."" But no major shifts in policy are expected. White House aides suggest that the meeting will be a success if the governor even temporarily tempers his sometimes-harsh words for the administration. ??""The president's focus is going to be on solving problems. He's not interested in finger-pointing,"" White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. ??""Whether people agree, or disagree, with the specifics of his energy plan, I think most Americans and most Californians are very pleased to see a president who is leading and taking action in addressing the issue head on."" ??However, recent public opinion polls show the president and the governor taking hits for the energy crisis in California. ??The Field Poll, finished a week ago, found that 54 percent of those surveyed believed Bush had handled the energy problems poorly, with Davis faring somewhat better at 38 percent. The margin of error for the 1,015 California interviews was 3.2 percentage points. ??An earlier survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found Davis' job approval rating plummeting, from 63 percent in January to 46 percent in May, as the state's energy troubles escalated. Bush's overall approval rating was higher at 57 percent, but still just as many of those surveyed gave him low marks for his handling of energy issues. That margin of error, for 2001 interviews, was 2 percentage points. ??In short, political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said, Bush's visit to the state _ in his 19th week as president, after already visiting more than half the other states _ is long overdue. ??""His not responding, or not being perceived to respond, to the short-term needs of California has allowed Davis' arguments to resonate _ that the federal government is uncaring, is insensitive,"" Jeffe said. ??In his national energy policy unveiled nearly two weeks ago, Bush offered a series of mostly long-term recommendations to conserve energy, find more of it and substantially upgrade and expand the nation's oil refineries and transmission systems for natural gas and electricity. ??Davis, complaining that Texas energy companies in particular are gouging Californians, has urged Bush to embrace price controls for wholesale electricity, but the president has steadfastly refused. Vice President Dick Cheney, who oversaw development of the White House energy policy, emphasized as recently as Friday that there's no quick fix on the way for California. ??""Long term, the answer is to build more power plants, and that's exactly what they're doing,"" Cheney told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""But they're not going to have enough new capacity online this summer to avoid blackouts."" ??So the energy woes continue to fester in California. It's not just electricity and rolling blackouts. Gasoline prices of $2-and-more-a-gallon have become commonplace as well. ??""The gas bothers me more than the electric,"" said Tait Kmentt, who runs a legal process serving business in Irvine, Calif. ""Gas prices are killing me."" ??At $2.25-a-gallon for premium gasoline, he says, it costs him more than $40 to fill up his new Mercedes _ with no relief in sight. ??A newcomer to the state, Kmentt voted for Bush last fall and said he's glad the president is finally visiting California. But Kmentt cautioned, ""This will be a big test to see how concerned he is."" ??Kmentt said he understands the state's energy troubles are a ""huge problem that can't be fixed overnight,"" and right now he's blaming the power companies for the high price of electricity. ??""I just think the public is being lied to,"" he said. ??Still, this is not good news for Bush, who has been increasingly portrayed by Democrats as a Texas oilman still beholden to the industry. California, which he lost last fall to Al Gore by 12 percentage points, has become increasingly a political headache. ??Where his predecessor, Bill Clinton, seemed politically and personally comfortable, Bush is not, suggests Jeffe, a senior scholar in the School of Policy, Planning and Development at the University of Southern California. ??""An ego cannot be buoyed by losing the state by 12 points,"" she said. ""We are the state that was responsible for giving Al Gore his popular vote victory."" ??With the Senate now headed for Democratic control, Jeffe said, Bush's visit to California _ and others that will surely follow _ are essential to help Republicans hold their base in the House. ??If the energy crisis persists in California, further punishing its economy, the ripple effects will certainly spread, she said. ??""George Bush remembers the influence of the economy on the career of an incumbent president,"" Jeffe said, pointing to Bush's father, who was defeated by Clinton during an economic slump in 1992. ??""It took a while,"" she said, ""but people are beginning to get angry."" ??(c) 2001, The Dallas Morning News. ??Visit The Dallas Morning News on the World Wide Web at http://www.dallasnews.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: DA LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ??????????????????????May 29, 2001 Tuesday ?Home Edition SECTION: California; Part 2; Page 1; Metro Desk LENGTH: 1178 words HEADLINE: Governor to Stress Price Caps to Bush; Power: In a meeting today with the president, Davis will present a letter from economists backing cost controls and demand federal assistance. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis will present a letter to President Bush today from top economists advocating wholesale electricity price controls, warning Monday that a failure by Bush to help California solve its energy crisis could signal to other regions that he may ignore their pleas. ??Bush, making his first trip to California, has set aside 20 minutes this afternoon to meet with Davis in Century City. In an interview with The Times, the Democratic governor vowed to repeat his request that the federal government move to cap wholesale power prices. Failure to act swiftly threatens the state and national economy, Davis said. ??""I want him to understand,"" Davis said, ""that if California has to pay 700 times more for electricity in 2001 than it did just two years ago, it could well drag our economy into a recession and could conceivably trigger a national recession. That is not good for anyone."" ??In the letter, 10 economists, including Cornell professor emeritus Alfred Kahn, a major proponent of airline deregulation, told of their ""deep concern"" about the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to stabilize wholesale electricity prices in California. The economists faxed the letter to the White House on Friday afternoon, and provided the governor with a copy to present to Bush today. ??""FERC's failure to act now will have dire consequences for the state of California and will set back, potentially fatally, the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country,"" the economists, led by Frank Wolak of Stanford University, wrote. ""Moreover, this negative experience with electricity restructuring could delay or reverse current efforts to introduce competition into other formerly regulated industries."" ??Davis called the letter ""very significant validation of what we've been saying: The marketplace is not working and FERC has an obligation to act."" ??""We're not pleading for relief; we're entitled to it,"" Davis said. ??Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly have said such controls never work. In California, caps might worsen the situation by limiting supply, they have argued, resulting in more blackouts this summer when demand for electricity is highest. ??The Bush-Davis meeting has had all the buildup of the political equivalent of a title fight: On one side, the Democratic governor of the nation's most populous state, which Bush lost by more than 1 million votes in November. On the other, the new president, coming off a roller coaster week of political defeat (the shift in control of the Senate) and victory (passage of his tax-cut plan), whose work in the Texas oil industry gives him a special history in the topic at hand. ??From afar, Davis has battled the Bush administration's energy policy. But, said Dan Bartlett, one of the president's chief communications advisors, ""The president has some interesting views on this topic as well, with some experience himself."" ??Bush's Energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, took steps Monday to increase electricity transmission capacity in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Energy Department that is responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states, to finish its planning for extra transmission capacity. ??At issue is so-called Path 15, an 84-mile stretch of power lines with insufficient capacity to carry the necessary load between Southern California and the northern part of the state, especially during peak hours. The central question is whether financing is available for a new transmission line. ??Davis lauded the action but said the president needs to do more. ??""If I have any advice to him of a political nature, it is take a chapter out of President Clinton's book. ??"" [Clinton] was very attentive to California, and as a result did better in 1996 than he did in '92. People felt he was here for us when we needed help. We need help."" ??Davis said that on a recent trip to Chicago, officials there worried that if Bush ""won't offer California some relief, he may not offer us relief,"" in a catastrophe. ??Among the facts and figures Davis intends to show the president is a chart showing that California paid $1.2 billion for electricity in the first quarter of 1999, $1.8 billion for the same period last year, and as much as $10.3 billion for electricity in the first three months of this year--at a time when conservation efforts had been taking hold and demand was down. ??""I hope the president will be as stunned as I am,"" said Davis, who is watching as the state spends more than $55 million a day to buy electricity that private utilities can no longer afford. ??Davis said that though he is trying to speed construction of power plants, encourage conservation, and return the private utilities to financial stability, the federal government has control over wholesale power prices. ??""Therein lies the final piece of this puzzle,"" Davis said. ""If it falls into place, we're on the way to putting this issue behind us. If it doesn't fall into place, it could create real economic havoc here and across the country."" ??Davis said that if Bush refuses to impose price controls, he should ""find some way to help us, consistent with his own belief."" ??""Turning a deaf ear not only won't be well received here,"" Davis said. ""It likely won't be received well elsewhere."" ??The state's energy crisis has posed a ticklish dilemma for Bush's busy travel schedulers: Had he visited earlier, it would have been awkward not to focus on energy issues. But until 11 days ago when a task force led by Cheney produced energy proposals, there would have been little Bush could say. ??Karen Hughes, the president's counselor, made it clear that regardless of the pressure, Bush will not yield on price caps. ??""We want to help. The president is very concerned about the energy situation and blackouts,"" she said. But limiting the wholesale price of energy would only discourage its production,"" Hughes said. ??California is the 30th state Bush has visited since taking office Jan. 20. His staff said the delay had to do not with energy issues but with politics and geography. ??With the administration focused in its first months on winning approval of the tax cut, the president's travels were largely dictated by that effort, his aides said. ??Besides, the president confided recently, even with Air Force One at the ready, it just takes too long to fly from Washington to California. ??Still, Hughes said, the president is not ignoring California. Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security advisor and a former Californian, sits next to Hughes every morning at the daily meeting of the White House senior staff, she said. ??What's more, the president ""has many friends in California,"" Hughes said, adding: ""Ernie has a home in California these days."" Ernie is the Bush family cat that is living with a friend in Brentwood while the First Family lives in the White House. ??* ??Times Staff Writer Massie Ritsch contributed to this story.

BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: McKITTRICK, Calif. BODY: ??You could think of this as California's own little slice of west Texas. ??Here in the scruffy brown hills of western Kern County, oil rigs grow more easily than trees, pickups are more common than cars, and chicken fried steak is the most popular dish at Mike and Annie's McKittrick Hotel. ??The hotel--which no longer offers lodging, just food and drink, and plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone Star construction camp. Just down the road, a mammoth electrical power plant is rising out of the sagebrush, its generators housed in four boxy buildings the size of airplane hangars. ??It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years, an electrical construction boom unmatched anywhere in California. Kern, which already has a large surplus of electricity, is cementing its place as California's energy capital, assuming far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained power supplies. ??Over the next several years, the county will add nearly 5,000 megawatts of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports, on average, from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five counties the size of Kern, which fills the dusty southern rim of the San Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662,000. ??In some parts of the state, a proposal to build a new power plant is a call to throw up the barricades. In recent months, intense community opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plants in South Gate and San Jose, although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive plans for the San Jose plant. ??You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County. ??""There should be power plants in everybody's backyard,"" said Paul Gipe, chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club, which did not oppose any of the new plants. ""If people are concerned about having too many power plants, they should think twice when they flip on the light switch."" ??New, natural gas-fired power plants, Gipe reasoned, are relatively clean and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution problems. Ideally, he said, they will allow the state to close some older, dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage. ??If environmentalists don't oppose the plants, it's not too much of a leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them. ??Just try, for instance, asking somebody in Taft, an oil center south of McKittrick. ""It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look at it,"" said Pamela Dunlap, who runs a downtown thrift shop. ??An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry ??She stood in the twilight outside her shop, on a street that embodies many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or war heroes in prominent public places, Taft has erected small oil rigs and other pieces of drilling machinery, a reminder of its economic roots. ??That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is, perhaps, not surprising. ??To begin with, there's geography. Kern stands astride California's major north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which they divide between the service areas of Pacific Gas & Electric, which serves Northern California, and Southern California Edison. That spot can be pinpointed as the Midway substation, a vast jungle of humming wires, transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow. ??Already, massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the coming months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant, the one near McKittrick; and Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant, just south of Taft. ??The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines, which will be tapped to run the plants. In fact, Kern contains the state's largest known reservoirs of natural gas. ??Another of Kern's geographic advantages? ??""You look around, and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living around here,"" observed Stephen Whaley, who is overseeing construction of the Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills, an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in the morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape, bisecting a crisscross of steam pipes, fuel lines and electrical wires. ??""This area is all about oil,"" Whaley said. Casting a glance at the modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him, he added with a wry smile, ""You know, I guess you could look at this from the road, and you could make the argument that it improves the looks."" ??The Sunrise plant, a relatively simple single-cycle plant, is expected to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1, a scant nine months after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years, assuming all receive final approval. ??The lack of major opposition to the plants is, of course, another reason developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long had a more intimate relationship with energy--oil, gas, electricity--than most places. To people here, the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb, or an oil derrick and a gas pedal, is neither theoretical nor especially threatening. They're comfortable with energy. ??Kern produces more crude oil than any other county in the United States outside Alaska. Property taxes from oil companies have helped build handsome new schools in Bakersfield, the county seat and largest city. The companies' big payrolls have helped populate elegant subdivisions with names that sound vaguely Houstonian: Seven Oaks, River Oaks, Landmark Estates. ??Which brings us to the Texas connection. ??It's hard to overlook it, in a county that runs on oil and cotton and boasts a country music scene to rival Austin's. Conversations in the finer Bakersfield restaurants are filled with references to trips to Texas, of colleagues in Midland and Odessa. A Bakersfield radio station was running a contest recently: The winners would be flown to a bull riding championship in Houston. ??Until December 1999, American Airlines offered direct jet service between Bakersfield and Dallas. It stopped after Occidental Petroleum moved its headquarters from Bakersfield to Houston. ??This is a county where President Bush received more support in the November election than he did in Texas, his home state. But then, Bush already had a Bakersfield connection: He lived there briefly as a child when his father, former President George Bush, worked in the Kern oil fields. ??""You look at the topography around Bakersfield, and the county's morals and ethics--that predominantly conservative attitude that we have around here--and you look at the oil, and you could be in Midland,"" said John Allen, the general manager of Occidental of Elk Hills, which is developing a power plant in tandem with Sempra Energy of San Diego. ??A lot of people in Kern County will tell you they don't mind being an energy farm for the state. It's a living, after all. ??""It's good to be working at home,"" said Joe Ryan, a Bakersfield pipe welder who has spent years on the road seeking the heavy construction work that seemed to have vanished in his hometown. Now he's working at the La Paloma plant, a 1,048-megawatt behemoth that will come online in phases beginning in December. ??About 800 people are at work on the plant, and several hundred more will be employed in the coming months. And after that plant is done, there will be others to build. ??""This is a good job here, I tell you what,"" said Ryan, 47, who has been banking his overtime on six 10-hour days a week--sometimes more. ??County Sees Itself as 'Part of the Solution' ??But there are some signs of simmering resentment, especially among county leadership. After all, if every other county produced just half the electricity that Kern generates, California wouldn't have an energy crisis. And people in Kern County are getting hit with the same spring-loaded electricity bills, the same rolling blackouts as everybody else. ??""I think the people of California are either going to be part of the solution or part of the problem,"" said Assemblyman Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield). ""And in Kern County, we have a long history of being part of the solution, especially when it comes to energy issues."" ??Elsewhere in the state, Ashburn sees ""a lot of arrogance--people who enjoy the benefits of a very high quality of life, enjoy the benefits of electric power for jobs and for their personal life, but with an exclusivity that it's someone else's problem to create that for them. We don't have that attitude in Kern County."" ??Power Buildup in Kern County ??Six new major gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years, making the county the power capital of the state. ??* ??RELATED STORY ??Letter to Bush: Gov.

SANGER DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 28 BODY: ??Days after he suffered the biggest political setback of his four-month-old presidency and then won the tax cut that he staked his campaign upon, President Bush traveled tonight to California, carefully calibrating how to deal with the state's energy crisis. ??After Memorial Day celebrations in Washington and Mesa, Ariz., Mr. Bush began his first visit as president to the most populous state, which he lost by roughly 12 percentage points in November's election. The visit seems likely to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and political strategies. ???Mr. Bush will meet briefly on Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis, who will insist, as he did again today, that the federal government impose price caps on wholesale electric power. ??The White House says Mr. Bush will refuse, again. He will argue that such caps would only discourage increased production of electric power. ""We think that's a mistake,"" Vice President Dick Cheney said on Friday, talking about why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the administration made public 10 days ago. ??But Mr. Bush knows that how he handles the California energy crisis could prove critical to his political fortunes, especially now that his party's loss of control in the Senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major elements of his energy plan. ??Moreover, the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high energy prices is a tax cut, because that is now legislative history. As one of his aides said this weekend, after Congress approved the $1.35 trillion tax cut that will be phased in over the next 10 years, ""we will have to turn now to the other arguments."" ??Most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow California in a partial deregulation of the market, with disastrous results. ??Repeatedly Mr. Bush has chastised California's politicians, and by implication Mr. Davis himself, for ignoring politically unpalatable choices to avert the state's power-generating crisis. Ten days ago, standing in front of a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush used the state as Exhibit A for his argument about what happens when population rises, when over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the stringing of new transmission lines, and when politicians fail to plan for the long term. ??""The problems in California shows that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence,"" Mr. Bush said then. ??At the same time, his aides were pointing to polls showing Mr. Davis's approval ratings plunging. They did not mention that Mr. Bush's ratings in the state were hardly any better. A series of recent polls show that roughly two-thirds of Californians believe Mr. Bush should be doing far more to help the state, though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. ??So Mr. Bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day visit here, trying to find ways to differ with Mr. Davis without seeming callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. ??The betting is that Mr. Bush will focus on long-term solutions, in contrast to Mr. Davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. ??The effort started today. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued an order of chiefly symbolic importance, saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state. ??""The level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year,"" the Energy Department said. It said that it would proceed with studies of how the land could be acquired, by eminent domain if necessary, and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. ??But Mr. Abraham left wide open the question of whether Washington would go ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. ??""The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,"" Mr. Abraham said. ""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??The statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with Mr. Davis, which will be closed to the press. So will a meeting with energy entrepreneurs. (Mr. Bush passed on Mr. Davis's suggestion of a forum with small-business owners and residents who have seen the lights go out.) ??Few expect Mr. Bush or Mr. Davis to change his mind about energy caps after their meeting. ??But for Mr. Bush it will not all be tough love. On Tuesday morning Mr. Bush is scheduled to travel to Camp Pendleton to repeat his call for the military and other federal users of power in California to flip off their switches whenever possible. But given his own comments, and Mr. Cheney's, about the limited utility of conservation, that order could strike some Californians as a little hollow. ??Later he will give a trade speech in Los Angeles, underscoring the message that if California hopes to remain the world's greatest exporter of high technology -- if it were a nation, California would be the world's sixth-largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver electricity. ??Already, leading Silicon Valley companies are threatening to build their next-generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere, probably in Texas, which has a surplus of generating capacity, a move that would further undermine Mr. Davis's stewardship. ??In fact, Mr. Bush's Texas roots will never be far from the political battlefield here. Mr. Davis has accused Texas energy companies of profiteering at California's expense. To press the case, he has hired two political operatives from the Clinton White House, Marc D. Fabiani and Chris Lehane, who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the case for price caps. ??California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, also a Democrat, suggested to The Wall Street Journal last week that some time in jail would be the best way to deal with one of Mr. Bush's biggest supporters -- Kenneth Lay, who heads the Enron Corporation and has sought to influence the selection of members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ??The comments may have been partly facetious, but they were not interpreted that way here. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ??????????????????????????The Orange County Register 29, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K7500 LENGTH: 825 words HEADLINE: California's power crisis generating lots of heat BYLINE: By John Howard BODY: ??SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Detectives would seem to be tripping over each other to discover who did what to whom, and why, in California's energy crisis. ??While electricity may be scarce, investigations are plentiful. A dozen major probes are afoot, many overlap, and more loom. The atmosphere is heated, the rhetoric strong. State, federal and local investigators, along with court officers, financial experts and special investigators, are poring over thousands of pages of documents from government agencies and private companies. ??At the top of the swarming heap is the $10 million investigation mounted by the state Attorney General's Office to answer the core question: Did a handful of power sellers fix prices to bilk Californians of billions of dollars? ??But it's not just the government that is busy. The companies themselves _ which have categorically denied any wrongdoing _ are overwhelmed by the scrutiny. ??""We are supplying reams and reams of documents. ... It is a distraction from our day-to-day work, there's no question,"" said Tom Williams of North Carolina-based Duke Energy, which operates several power plants in California. ""It affects our employees and their families, this barrage of innuendo. I don't know what more we can do."" ??Accompanying the investigations are at least a half-dozen lawsuits against the companies by individuals. Like the probes, the suits contend the companies improperly manipulated the market. Legislative leaders, meanwhile, have sued the federal government, contending it has failed to protect consumers from price-gouging. ??""This all permeates our business in so many ways,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western States Power Forum, a group that represents power sellers and buyers in the West. ""It even affects my ability to talk to the newspapers, because we're afraid statements may turn up later and be used as evidence. We're not sure what we're dealing with, whether a suit or even a grand jury if the (attorney general) decides to take criminal action, as he said he might."" ??The state's top prosecutor said that, indeed, criminal charges are a possibility. ??""There is an investigation under way that involves potential criminal conduct,"" said Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer. It could be at least eight weeks before that probe is completed, she said. ??Other investigating agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission, the city attorneys' offices in Long Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco; California's grid manager, the Independent System Operator; the obscure Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the ISO; and the state Senate and Assembly. ??The state has even considered asking two more federal agencies, the Department of Energy and the Federal Trade Commission, to get into the act. Some offices are conducting multiple investigations. In the case of at least two agencies, the PUC and the Attorney General's Office, the investigations are being at least partly coordinated. Some agencies are examining the same issues. The PUC, the attorney general and ISO, for example, all are looking at whether power plants were shut down to drive up demand and prices. ??""There is a lot of overlap and there probably are problems of coordination,"" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco, a grass-roots watchdog group. ??With so many agencies trying to extract information, Hoge said, even those who have done no wrong are concerned about talking freely because of the greater likelihood that proprietary information will leak to competitors. ??Others feel the overlap is beneficial. ??""When you're up against an industry as wealthy and powerful as the energy industry, it's probably better to double-team them,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ??Hoge believes that if any investigation is going to produce results, it will be Lockyer's, ""because the governor has thrown all the resources that way."" ??Investigators have requested mountains of paperwork.

Those that weren't blamed it all on that most familiar of modern scapegoats, the computer. ???Computers must be kept cool -- in the 60s for big mainframes and a bit more for the smaller units most folks use, though some can go into the 80s without hiccuping. So generally, people who work alongside the computers get to keep cool, by association, although it's the computer that counts. ???The ISO headquarters, located in an industrial park 20 miles east of Sacramento, is a delightfully cool and comfortable place when the outside temperature soars into the 90s and 100s. ???The reception area, the only room accessible to the outraged public, is a fairly stiff 76 degrees -- only two degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush and the federal energy crisis czars and czarinas. ???But take a step past the lobby security doors and the temperature plummets. In the main hallway, the temperature is 73 degrees. And in the control room, where two dozen engineers and technicians sit at consoles and monitor the flow of California electricity on a giant diagram of state power lines so they can order blackouts for everyone else -- the temperature is 69 degrees. ???NO SWEATING AT ISO ???Some managers do not take off their sports coats and jackets. ???""We want these people to be comfortable,"" explained Tony Capasso, facilities manager for the ISO complex. ""We don't want these people sweating bullets in the middle of a crisis."" ???Inside the state Capitol, where legislators and the governor preach compliance with federal guidelines calling for 78-degree thermostats, the temperature dips into the high 60s. The coolest spots are the press briefing room and the treasurer's old office. ???GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ???The governor's suite is in the mid-70s, apparently because folks are often coming by with thermometers and it wouldn't do not to set an example. Press secretary Steve Maviglio said Governor Gray Davis is a practice-what-he-preaches kind of guy who keeps corridors dark, shades drawn, air conditioners idle. His personal secretary works in short sleeves, with a cheap plastic fan humming nearby. ???""It's so dark in the hall that we're always bumping into things,"" said one aide. ???Even so, the temperature in the governor's suite of offices is three degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush -- not the first time the two men have failed to agree. ???THE LEGISLATURE ???The Assembly chamber is 71 degrees while the Senate chamber -- with 40 fewer legislators spewing forth -- is 73 degrees. But the Senate chamber has a southern exposure, one Capitol guide explained. ???""Hot air from the people sitting inside has nothing to do with it,"" he said. ???In San Francisco, the temperature inside cavernous City Hall dips in spots to the mid-60s. College student Jasmine Westbrook, who dropped by with her art class on a project to sketch the interior of the building, was doing her sketching while wearing a windbreaker to keep warm. ???""I want to stay comfortable,"" she said. ""It think it's supposed to be hotter in here, isn't it?"" ???The mayor's office, at 73 degrees, was eight degrees warmer than another office down the hall, even without the mayor sitting in it. ???63 AT THE PUC ???At the headquarters of the state Public Utilities Commission, which is supposed to be keeping an eye on the self-declared bankruptcy of the utility that mails out the bills, the lobby temperature is 63 degrees. ???Chief engineer David Omosheyin, eyeing The Chronicle's thermometer nervously, insisted the 63-degree reading was caused by the lobby's proximity to the front door, where the outside temperature at the moment was in the low 60s. He invited the thermometer to visit the upper floors, where the temperature was 70. ???As for San Francisco's federal buildings: Bush would probably not frown. ???His orders appeared to be followed during The Chronicle's visits, so much so that it was actually hotter inside than out. Though that wouldn't be hard, considering it was in the low 60s outside. And the places measured happened to be courtrooms and tax offices, where the body heat from anxiety alone could probably melt the paint some days. ???San Franciscans, Omosheyin said, are losing their perspective when it comes to things like electricity, energy alerts and rolling blackouts. In his native country of Nigeria, he said, the electricity runs sporadically, if at all. ???""There the power can go off for a week,"" he said. ""The world goes on. Here, people take a lot of things for granted, and electricity is one of them."" ???As for the offices of the places that report on such matters, they fared about the same. ???The Walnut Creek bureau of The Chronicle, where the sun sizzles into the 90s with regularity in the summer, is kept at 67 degrees because of all the computers.

Brad Sherman, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks who met Air Force One on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport along with a group of high school students, wasted no time button-holing the president for what appeared to be an animated conversation. ???""I brought up . . . the idea that after his meeting with our governor, I hoped he would be in favor of wholesale regulation (of energy prices),"" Sherman said later. ""He disagreed with me."" ???Sherman -- who two weeks ago suggested that the headline to the president's national energy policy should be ""Bush to California: Drop Dead"" -- didn't seem optimistic yesterday about Bush's 48-hour visit to the state. ""I think that the president's policies show either a lack of understanding of what's really going on in California, or a lack of concern,"" he said. ???That vignette underscored some of the challenges facing Bush, who arrived in California as protesters geared up and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis prepared to press him for federal action on the state's power troubles. ???Besides Sherman, Bush was greeted by a crowd of cheering Republicans, including Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the former a declared GOP candidate for governor in 2002, the latter a rumored one. ???But today, Bush will sit down with the present governor, who lately has been blistering in his criticism of the president. ???""The last time I looked, California was still part of the United States of America,"" Davis told reporters this weekend. ""We have contributed disproportionately to the economic growth of this country. There's no reason why a president should not respond to a legitimate request from the chief executive of the largest state in the union."" ???In his first visit to California since just before the election, Bush plans to emphasize the energy crisis -- but will focus on it through the lens of his own energy plan. ???ENERGY SECRETARY ACTS ???Just hours before the president landed, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham ordered a speedup in planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electricity transmission line in California. ???Abraham's holiday action was timed to provide a bit of positive news for Bush to announce in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of the Energy Department, to complete planning and seek outside financing to reduce the transmission bottleneck on California's Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???This morning, Bush will visit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities. ???In Los Angeles, he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affairs Council and lead a discussion among business leaders about technological advances in energy conservation. ???Then, he will head to Fresno and Sequoia National Park to press his initiative to improve national parks. Along the way, protesters have vowed to provide a vocal commentary on Bush's energy and environmental policies. ???But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush and Davis today. The governor pushed for a lengthy, open meeting with Bush that would include testimony from officials and consumers affected by the energy crisis. Bush's camp announced Friday the meeting would be 20 to 30 minutes -- in private. ???Davis plans to outline steps the state has taken to alleviate the energy crisis, and what it wants the federal government to do -- including implementing price caps on the wholesale cost of energy, cost-based pricing, and the possibility of ordering refunds. ???DAVIS THREATENING SUIT ???The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it does not impose temporary price caps. ???And the state Legislature has already filed a suit, saying the commission has failed to stop what it has determined are ""unjust and unreasonable prices."" ???With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts predicted, the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls for both leaders, both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of their handling of the energy crisis. ???Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California, a state that gave a 12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election. ???But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that the president had arrived to show he cares, Vice President Dick Cheney again chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis ""because all of the action was potentially unpleasant."" ???And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price caps, saying, ""We think that's a mistake."" ???Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's troubles and only underscored the perception of an ""all-oil, all-the-time ticket."" ???Davis, whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling of the crisis, has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energy firms, particularly those from Texas, in recent weeks. ???And yesterday, signaling no letup, Davis' supporters made an unusual holiday conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued that without immediate intervention from the Bush administration, the economy of California -- and potentially the entire nation -- was at risk. ???'THIS ENORMOUS SHOCK' ???""We have this enormous shock in prices that needs to be addressed and not ignored,"" said Joseph Fichero, head of Sabre Partners and a consultant to Davis. ???Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that energy woes in California alone would ""take almost a half a percent of the gross domestic product off of the national economy."" ???Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months -- is necessary while new power plants are being built. ???""Most times and most places, I agree price caps are not the long-run solution, but they can be part of a short-term solution,"" Blinder said. ""There really is a case for temporary price caps to shield consumers and the California and national economy from the full force of the energy shock."" ???Limited new price caps approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the sale of wholesale electricity begin today in California. But the temporary caps, which go into effect when the electricity reserves dip below 7.5 percent, have been lambasted by Davis as ineffective and inadequate. ???Political analysts say Bush's resistence on the issue could cost him in California -- and elsewhere. ???""(California) is probably an area where he is criticized more than any other region in the country,"" said Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide Field Poll.

Gray Davis will urge President Bush today to back a 2-year cap on electricity costs as the best way to keep his power-starved state -- and possibly the U.S. economy -- from sinking into recession. ???The Democratic governor and Republican president, who have been sparring from afar over energy policy, will meet here to discuss their differences. The White House has said repeatedly that it opposes price caps as a way to deal with energy shortages in California. ??In an interview with USA TODAY, Davis said a limit on wholesale electricity costs is needed while the state attempts to build 15 new power plants. He said that would still allow a 30% profit margin. ??""While the president didn't create this problem, he is uniquely situated to solve it,"" Davis said. ""I'll make clear that he has an opportunity to relieve the pain and give California the breathing space to put more plants online."" ???Bush, making his first visit to California as president, unveiled a long-term energy policy this month that calls for increased production and, to a lesser extent, conservation. The president will promote conservation steps being taken by the federal government during a visit today to the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. ??""The president believes that imposing price caps will only make the problem worse,"" White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said. ??Davis, whose popularity has plummeted as Californians cope with blackouts to offset electricity shortages, said his state's problems could hurt all Americans if they are not dealt with quickly. ""I'm asking for some form of relief that reduces the outrageous prices we're currently bearing,"" he said. ""Without that relief, lots of people will lose their businesses, and California could well be dragged into a recession. Since we're about one-eighth of the national economy, that doesn't bode well for America."" ???The California Public Utilities Commission has announced rate increases of up to 50% for businesses and 37% for homes. ??Bush has sidestepped California after losing the state by 12 percentage points to Democrat Al Gore last year in the presidential election. But with Democrats targeting several GOP House members in next year's elections, Republicans must go on the offensive or risk losing control of the closely divided House of Representatives. ??Davis, a possible presidential candidate in 2004, said he wants to avoid rancor with Bush: ""I'm saying, 'Look, we got into this in a bipartisan way.

Gray Davis (D) on Tuesday. Bush's aides said he will pledge to cooperate with California but will stick to his position that no action by the federal government can prevent the rolling blackouts expected this summer. ???Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of his department, to complete planning and seek outside financing for an increase in transmission capacity that he said would be ""a big step in the right direction, and a big step forward for Californians."" ???""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight,"" Abraham said in a news release. ""However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" Today's action is designed to reduce the bottleneck on California's Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???Davis, who is seeking reelection next year, has seen his poll ratings plummet as electricity prices soared, utilities hit dire financial straits, and homes and businesses were surprised with blackouts. ???Bush has taken several steps to try to encourage additional power generation in the state but has maintained since before he took office that California's problems were created here -- through a troubled effort at electricity deregulation and public opposition to construction of additional power plants -- and would have to be solved here. ???Davis plans to use the meeting to lobby Bush once again to endorse a cap by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the wholesale price of electricity. Again and again, the administration has said it will not take that step. ???""This administration does not, and will not, support energy price controls,"" Bush told a business audience in March. ""Price controls do not increase supply, and they do not encourage conservation. Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s. And the United States will not repeat the mistake again."" ???Davis energy advisers told reporters on a conference call today that without the cap, California energy costs could be $ 50 billion higher this year than two years ago. Alan S. Blinder, the Princeton University economist and former Federal Reserve Bank vice chairman, said on the call that California's energy crisis ""should be enough to get the attention of policymakers in Washington."" ???The visit by Bush, who flew here after making a Memorial Day speech at a fighter aircraft museum in Mesa, Ariz., is being carefully managed to avoid contact with the general public.

As Bush departs, Davis plans to make an immediate statement for cameras. ???Although Bush says he has taken more than a dozen steps to help California, Davis says price caps are essential, and has said he may sue the federal government in an effort to get them if Bush does not go along. ???""He has been helpful on a number of small matters, and I appreciate his assistance,"" Davis said during a telephone interview on Friday.

A03 LENGTH: 1936 words HEADLINE: It's Still Dawn for Solar Power in L.A.; Despite City Subsidies, Homeowners Hesitate to Install Expensive Alternative Energy Source BYLINE: William Booth, Washington Post Staff Writer DATELINE: LOS ANGELES BODY: ???One year ago this city announced its intent to become ""the Solar Capital of the World,"" with 100,000 roofs covered with solar electric panels by the end of the decade, an audacious goal to transform the homes of this smoggy but sunny metropolis into miniature power plants. ???To fulfill what is perhaps the nation's most ambitious solar campaign, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power began offering substantial ""buy down"" subsidies that would reimburse rate payers for half the price of each new solar energy system. For the average home, a photovoltaic package costs between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000, parts and labor included, before the rebate. ???How many have been installed? ???At last count, about 40. ???That leaves only 99,960 rooftops to go. ???The Bush administration, and especially Vice President Cheney, architect of its energy plan, have been criticized for skepticism regarding alternative energy sources. But a close examination of the Los Angeles solar experiment and a review of similar programs suggest the former oilmen in the White House have a point: Solar, at least, has not proven ready for prime time. ???For all of Los Angeles's good intentions, and for all of solar's many positive attributes, the problems of harnessing its power remain. Some of those challenges are economic and some technological; others are more mundane, but often ignored, such as finding a qualified contractor a homeowner can trust to drill dozens of holes in the roofs to mount the things. ???In a reprise of the 1980s, solar again is hot. The price of photovoltaics is dropping and interest is growing. Other states such as New York, Arizona, Florida and Washington are moving to join California in major efforts to wire homes to draw power from the sun. ???But as many Americans are beginning to understand, the delivery of energy is like a complex, interconnected assembly line, and the devil lurks in the details. ???The Los Angeles experiment tells the story shared by other locales. In L.A., for example, the city's lone solar panel manufacturer has not been able to supply enough systems to meet demand. ???The systems, too, are often oversold by solar proponents. In the real world, most do not pay for themselves in a few years, as some advocates claim, but take 20 years or more to return their initial cost in the form of reduced utility bills. ???Nor are the systems maintenance-free: At a minimum, the rooftop panels must be routinely cleaned of pollution, dust and leaves. ???They cannot be installed efficiently on homes without shade-free, south-facing roofs; the shadow from a neighbor's palm tree can frustrate the system's photovoltaic cells. ???Nor will the most common systems allow buyers to live ""off the grid,"" unless they want to purchase a large bank of batteries. Even with the batteries, homeowners probably would not be able to run their washing machines and air conditioners at the same time. ???""It is not an economic proposition at this point,"" conceded Terry Peterson, a solar expert at Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif. But one day, Peterson predicts, 100 years from now, solar energy will provide a substantial percentage of the world's energy needs. In a decade or two, the cost of solar will likely be competitive with other energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear or coal. ???But now? It is still a luxury item. ""Like buying a swimming pool,"" Peterson said. ???""I really like the idea of running my house with solar power,"" said Andrew Chin, a potential customer in Los Angeles who has been researching a purchase. ""But they're still pretty expensive, even with the rebates, and so I gotta ask myself, what am I doing this for,"" his conscience or his wallet. ""I'm thinking I might wait until they work the kinks out."" ???The most knowledgeable and experienced solar contractor in Los Angeles is probably Graham Owen, the founder, owner and single full-time employee of Go Solar Co. ???His installation of a one-kilowatt solar electric system on a home in the San Fernando Valley was the first to be awarded a rebate by the Los Angeles power department in March. ???How many systems has he installed as part of the rebate program? Three. ???But Owen is a true believer, and over the next year, he plans to cover hundreds of roofs with solar panels. On his shelf, Owen still has an unreturned library book, ""The Coming Age of Solar Energy,"" published in 1963, and checked out from his high school in Lennox Hills, Ill., in 1979. ""I guess we're still stuck in the coming age of solar energy,"" he said, smiling. He recalled that the buzz about solar water heaters in the 1980s led to disappointment with shoddy workmanship and less than spectacular energy savings. ???Until recently, there has been little widespread interest in solar electric power. Since 1998, the California Energy Commission has been pushing its own program to encourage homeowners to erect photovoltaic panels on their roofs, offering to subsidize about one-third of the cost. ???Across a state with a population of about 35 million, only 450 solar energy systems have been installed on homes. ???Then the California energy crisis struck, with its power interruptions and steep rate increases, and the phone calls began to overwhelm Owen's voice mail. ???""On days with rolling blackouts? I get a hundred calls, maybe more,"" Owen says. His Web site, www.solarexpert.com, is now receiving 3,000 hits a day. Customers are begging him to do jobs. ???The Los Angeles power department reports a similar surge in interest since the energy crisis began six months ago. ""Customer demand has shot through the roof,"" says Angelina Galiteva, executive director for strategic planning at the Department of Water and Power. She estimates that her department receives 1,000 calls on some days about its solar subsidy program. ???Yet while the reliability and cost of solar electric technologies continue to improve, solar power today accounts for only a sliver of the national pie chart of energy production -- less than 1 percent. The country produces about 300 megawatts of electricity with solar -- about the same amount produced by a single mid-sized traditional power plant. ???The current trend for photovoltaics is not to erect large centralized solar farms in the desert, an experiment that withered in the 1980s, but to pursue ""distributed generation"" or individual units on scattered rooftops. ???The problem has consistently been the cost of the solar panels, which has been too steep to justify them, except for customers who are committed environmentalists or techies who like the elegance of the systems. ???Los Angeles began its solar experiment after Sacramento legislators mandated that utilities spend about 3 percent of their revenue on efficiency, conservation and renewable energy. For solar, the power department committed $ 75 million over the next five years -- enough to subsidize panels on 7,500 homes. ???The power department will pay $ 5 for each watt of solar installed on a residence or business. Homeowners typically purchase a one-kilowatt or two- kilowatt (1,000 or 2,000 watts, respectively) solar electric system, meaning that the municipal utility would pay between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 of the cost up front -- an enticing, tax-free offer. ???""For many years, I wanted to do solar, but it was so expensive,"" said LaWanda Geary in the San Fernando Valley, who in April had Owen install 32 panels for a two-kilowatt system on her sunny roof. ""The rebate really got me going. I don't know many times when the government offers to pay half of anything."" ???The systems that are eligible for rebates must be tied into a utility's electric power grid, meaning that during the day, when the sun is shining, the panels are adding a stream of electrons used by the home to run its lights and appliances. ???If there is a surplus of solar power, that electricity goes back into the power lines and is passed along to a neighbor, and the electric meter at the house actually runs backward. Homeowners, however, are not selling their excess electricity -- they're giving it away to the utility company. ???On cloudy days, and at night, the home is not being powered by solar energy, but getting its electricity the traditional way from the power lines. ???Calculations on savings vary. A two-kilowatt solar system can supply an average-sized home with 20 to 80 percent of its electrical needs, depending on how many lights, appliances and air conditioners are running, and how efficient they are. ???After the subsidy, and depending on how the system is paid for (in cash or with borrowed funds), a solar system can pay for itself in as little as six years and as much as 36 years. Owen assumes about 20 years. ???Potential solar clients, moreover, often mistakenly assume that going with the sun will take them off the grid, which is not possible without a large bank of batteries that costs several thousand dollars more. Because the solar panels are still wired to the power grid, if there is a blackout, the power in a solar house goes off, just like everyone else's. If uninterrupted power is needed, Owen suggests a diesel generator. ???Galiteva does cite one real advantage of solar: It reduces the electricity that must be purchased from power companies and protects, to some degree, a solar home from the full brunt of upwardly spiraling rate increases. Unfortunately for solar enthusiasts, the L.A. Department of Water and Power, which was not deregulated along with the three other major utilities in California, has perhaps the cheapest and most stable supply of electricity in the state, making the economic argument harder to make. ???To receive the full $ 5 per watt subsidy, the L.A. Department of Water and Power requires a homeowner to purchase solar panels from a manufacturer based in the city. The idea is not only to become the solar capital of the world but also to encourage local growth of an emerging industry and create jobs. ???One hitch is that no solar panel makers were located in Los Angeles. ???After lengthy negotiations, Siemens Solar Industries, based in Camarillo, Calif., an hour's drive to the north, announced in February that it would open a solar panel manufacturing plant in Los Angeles. But it is not a complete facility: The L.A. plant does only some final assembly and then the units must be returned to Camarillo for final testing and shipping. ???Tina Nickerson, a spokeswoman for Siemens Solar, estimates her company has sold ""a couple dozen"" to L.A. homeowners for the rebate program. But she, too, reports that the interest from consumers is sometimes overwhelming and that supply has been a problem. Most U.S.-manufactured units are shipped overseas to places such as Germany, Japan and Scandinavia, which have had generous subsidies in place for years. ???LaWanda Geary had to call Siemens herself to push them to deliver panels for her house -- and she was eligible for the rebate because of a stopgap compromise that allows to Siemens to ship solar panels from Camarillo until its L.A. plant is fully operational. ???Everyone involved concedes there have been bottlenecks. Siemens now says it has enough panels to begin to meet demand, and Owen and the city are hoping things will sort themselves out, especially if more solar manufacturers are drawn to Los Angeles. But proponents worry about what will happen when the subsidies run out. ???""Selling solar is now the easy part,"" Owen says. ""I could sell a hundred a week. It's getting them up on the roof that's the hard part."" LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ????????????????Copyright 2001 News World Communications, Inc.

As the ground got warmer, the larvae turned into flies and more medflies started appearing. It got out of hand, and ultimately I had to order malathion spraying. ?It would have been better had I taken forceful action at the first notice of the medfly."" ??Mr. ?Foster asked: ""Are you saying that the governor missed opportunities to act early, in the same way?"" ??Mr. ?Brown replied: ""There's an analogy there. ?I didn't want to spray because I knew the people in Santa Clara County didn't want to have helicopters spraying malathion over their homes. ?It didn't sound good. ?As governor, I wouldn't have wanted to see rate increases either. ?But sometimes you have to take your medicine early. ?It's less bitter than if you postpone it."" ??Mr. ?Davis served as Mr. ?Brown's chief of staff when the latter Democrat was governor. ??ENERGETIC CRITICISM ??President Bush's energy plan, already under fire from Democrats and environmentalists, is dismissed by National Review, the conservative magazine, as so much political posturing. ??""The hyperbolic attacks on the Bush plan by environmentalists (as an attempt to poison the air and kill the caribou) shouldn't trick conservatives into an exaggerated sense of its merit,"" the magazine says in an editorial in its current issue, dated June 11. ??""The basic thrust of the administration's thinking on energy is sound: a growing economy requires more energy, which in turn entails more production. But the Bush plan itself is a political document, meant to placate corporate interests, environmentalists, and everyone in between, and so is festooned with an embarrassment of subsidies and incentives that will, at best, prove an irrelevance. ??""As Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute writes in this issue, the phantom energy crisis is already healing itself. ?Power plants are being built at a rate that outpaces Dick Cheney's benchmark of one plant a week. Altogether, almost 100,000 new daily megawatts of electrcity capacity are scheduled to be available nationwide by next year. ?This is twice the amount of electricity that California now uses on an average day. ?While Cheney has been sitting with his advisers around a White House conference table, investors and entrepreneurs have been digging, building, and refining his energy problem into oblivion. ?By the time all the Bush plan's tax credits have kicked in, there may well be an energy glut. ?All of this is thanks to the most efficient energy plan known to man: market pricing."" ??WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS ??""The buzz in the media after Sen. ?James Jeffords' switch put Democrats in control of the Senate was that President Bush must change his ways. ?He has to become more moderate. ?Why? ?Because only that will prevent more Republican defections and it's the president's one hope for getting his agenda through Congress. ?This is wrong on both counts,"" Fred Barnes writes in the Weekly Standard. ??""Bush and GOP congressional leaders bent over backwards to accommodate Jeffords and liberal Democrats on education, the senator's top priority. Jeffords bolted anyway. ?On taxes, Bush stuck with his conservative tax cut until nearly the end, when he compromised just enough to assure passage. Jeffords voted with him,"" Mr. ?Barnes said. ??""The truth about the impact of Jeffords' move is that no political earthquake has occurred. ?The Senate is ideologically unchanged. ?The swing votes in the Senate, including John McCain, are important, but they already were. ?There's no clear path to victory for the Bush agenda, after taxes and education, but that was always true. ?To pass a patients' bill of rights, a prescription-drug benefit, or missile defense, a bipartisan coalition of some sort will be essential. ??""Yes, there's one big change with Democrats taking over: judges. ?Bush will have a harder time getting conservative nominees through a Senate Judiciary Committee run by Patrick Leahy, perhaps the most partisan Democrat on Capitol Hill. ?One more downbeat side effect: Jeffords' announcement overshadowed Bush's tax-cut victory, denying him any political momentum he might have gotten from it."" ??INCOHERENT REBEL ??""Before liberals put James Jeffords on Mount Rushmore, can we please stop and note how he's already betrayed Democrats and his own avowed principles by deciding that his defection won't take effect until after President Bush's wrongheaded tax cut has been signed into law?"" syndicated columnist Matthew Miller writes. ??""Any traitor (I mean, 'man of conscience') worth his salt shoves the knife in to the hilt - otherwise, what's the point? ?Machiavellis throughout history have wisely advised that when you move against the king, you'd better finish him off,"" Mr. ?Miller said. ??""Yet Jeffords took pains to make sure his switch wouldn't derail the centerpiece of Bush's agenda, the very agenda that inspired Jeffords' move and which Jeffords had the power to stop via his action. ??""We are dealing, in other words, with a deeply incoherent rebel. ?This would be a private matter for Jeffords to sort out with his therapist were not his cowardice in this moment of 'courage' so consequential for the country."" ??THE LONELY VERMONTER ??""In the final analysis, Vermont Sen. ?James M. ?Jeffords was out of step with his party, making his departure appropriate, if politically inconvenient. ?Those who argue that it was the party out of step with Jeffords, some political analysts are saying, are those who wish the Republicans no good."" UPI political analyst Peter Roff writes. ??""The conservative, low-tax, minimal-government Republican Party enjoys national parity with the Democrats, something the Northeastern liberal GOP could not achieve. ?Jeffords is, in that regard, these observers say, out of step with victory. ?One GOP consultant went so far as to say, 'If the Republicans were doing better in New England, Jeffords would not have been so lonely. ?Why is it that the people from states where the GOP usually doesn't win think they can tell the rest of us how to run the party and what we all should believe? ?It doesn't make sense.' (spade) ??""There are those in the GOP who regret the loss of the majority that Jeffords' defection brings, but very few, if any, are mourning the loss of the lonely Vermonter,"" Mr. ?Roff said. ??LAST WORDS ??Brill's Content asked PR pros how they would handle Vice President Richard B.

A4 LENGTH: 809 words HEADLINE: Bush faces tough sell on visit to California; Davis likely to be rebuffed on price caps BYLINE: Joseph Curl; THE WASHINGTON TIMES DATELINE: LOS ANGELES BODY: ??LOS ANGELES - Twenty minutes - that's how long Gov. ?Gray Davis, who has accused the Bush administration of ignoring California's energy crisis, will have to sway President Bush in a meeting today to consider imposing federal price caps on wholesale power prices. ??His plea likely will fall on deaf ears. ??""That's simply not going to happen,"" said one senior Bush official. Both Mr. Bush and Vice President Richard B. ?Cheney, who on Friday again blamed the state government of California for the energy crunch, oppose cap measures. ??In his first visit to California since the presidential election, where he lost the state to former Vice President Al Gore by 54 percent to 41 percent, Mr. Bush hopes to sell his national energy policy to a vocal group of opponents. But the hue and cry has been muted of late since residents have battled rolling blackouts and sky-high gasoline prices. ??A new poll released Friday shows 59 percent of Californians, many of whom have been longtime foes of nuclear energy, now believe the non-polluting energy source may be the way to solve the state's problems. ??Mr. ?Davis' popularity has plummeted. ?The Democrat, facing re-election next year and often mentioned as a presidential candidate, is viewed as having ""poor job performance"" by 60 percent of Californians, according to a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??In a small gesture to California, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham yesterday announced plans to increase transmission capacity in California, which he said would be a ""big step"" in easing rolling power blackouts. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration - an Energy Department arm responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states - to wrap up planning for building extra transmission capacity. ??The governor has repeatedly blamed Mr. ?Bush, who took office four months ago, for the energy crunch in California. ?He points the finger of blame far outside the state's boundaries, primarily at Washington and Mr. Bush's home state. ??""The people that have dropped the ball are the federal government,"" Mr. Davis said last week. ?""They need to reimpose a price cap because we're being obscenely gouged by price gougers out of Texas and the Southwest. ?. . . There's a massive transfer of wealth going on from ordinary citizens in California to Texas."" ??Mr. ?Davis has also charged that utility companies are withholding power in order to drive up prices, a claim the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has investigated and dismissed. ??Mr. ?Bush and Mr. ?Cheney have often pointed out that California is second only to Rhode Island in conservation efforts, but the state is on the brink of an energy supply collapse. ??Still, despite the state's failure to build new power plants, Mr. Davis says California is entitled to a federal bailout approved by Mr. Bush. ??""I'm going to keep asking him to do it because we're part of America. The state, the last three years, has led American economic growth. ?. . . We're doing everything we can out here,"" he said. ??In the Democratic response to the president's weekly radio address, Mr. Davis accused the president, a former oil man, of being concerned only with the petroleum magnates. ??""With all due respect, I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive responsibility to ensure that energy prices are reasonable,"" he said. ??Many analysts, however, blame the state's deregulation scheme and failure to construct adequate electrical generating capacity. ?The price wholesale power providers can charge utilities is not capped, but the fee those companies can charge users is capped - resulting in massive debt for providers. ??The state was slow to respond to increased demand, the analysts say, even though the state is building 10 new power plants, four of which will come on line this summer. ??In his national energy policy, Mr. ?Bush lays out 105 proposals that focus on increasing domestic supply, improving the nation's ability to move energy between regions and increased conservation. ?But the policy is geared more toward long-term solutions - such as decreasing America's reliance on foreign oil - than short-term relief for Californians and motorists nationwide. ??Mr. ?Cheney, who heads the president's energy task force and said Friday that California knew ""for more than a year"" about the impending energy shortage, has promoted nuclear power as essential to America's energy needs. ?He said that at least some of the 65 power plants that need to be built annually to meet future electricity demand ought to be nuclear. ??A poll by the Field Institute last week found many Californians now agree. Although nuclear energy produces 20 percent of the nation's energy, California has just two nuclear plants.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES BODY: ??President Bush promised World War II veterans a Washington memorial that ""will stand for the ages"" and paid Memorial Day tribute to America's fallen soldiers before embarking on a three-day West Coast swing to try to ease his political problems in California. ??Bush landed at ground zero of the nation's energy worries Monday night, hours after Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham speeded up planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electricity transmission line through California. ? ??Abraham's action was timed to provide a bit of news for Bush to announce during his first presidential trip to California, where he is to hold a politically charged private meeting with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday. Bush's aides said he will pledge to cooperate with California but will stick to his position that no action by the federal government can prevent the rolling blackouts that are expected this summer. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of his department, to complete planning and seek outside financing for an increase in transmission capacity that he said would be ""a big step in the right direction, and a big step forward for Californians."" ??""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight,"" Abraham said in a news release. ""However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" Monday's action is designed to reduce the bottleneck on California's Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ??Davis, who is seeking re-election next year, has seen his poll ratings plummet as electricity prices soared, utilities hit dire financial straits and homes and businesses were surprised with blackouts. ??For most of Monday, however, Bush focused on U.S. veterans and the solemn ceremonies in two states honoring those who never returned from America's wars. ??""Their losses can be marked, but not measured,"" Bush said at the traditional Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. ""We can never measure the full value of what was gained in their sacrifice. We live it every day, in the comforts of peace and the gifts of freedom."" ??Bush also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ??Later he traveled to Mesa, Ariz., to pay tribute to veterans at the Champlin Fighter Aircraft Museum. He asked the crowd to observe a nationwide moment of silence at 3 p.m. Arizona time. ??""Any foe who might challenge our national resolve will be repeating the grave error of defeated adversaries,"" the president said. ??Bush opened the day at the White House, where he signed legislation to construct a World War II monument on the National Mall, a setting criticized by some. Bush said the monument between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial ""will stand for the ages."" ??""I will make sure the monument gets built,"" the president told an audience of veterans in the yellow-curtained East Room, among them former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who has supported the memorial. ??. GRAPHIC: PHOTOPHOTO (color): President Bush and Maj. Gen. James T.

Gray Davis doesn't want to hear: He won't force down soaring electricity prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January. ??The Republican president and the embattled Democratic governor arranged a 20-meeting Tuesday to talk about California's energy crisis, but there was no indication they would break their stalemate. ??Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy, arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of the crisis. ??Davis contends federal energy regulators are ignoring their mandate to ensure ""just and fair"" electricity prices. ??With no sign of a break in the deadlock, each side maneuvered for maximum advantage from Bush's first full day in California as president. ??Davis, in an interview Tuesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" defended his record on licensing more power plants. ??""We've licensed 15 plants. Ten are under construction, four will be online this summer, four next summer, and by the end of 2003 we will have built our way out of this problem. But between now and then, we are getting gouged unbelievably,"" Davis said. ??The Bush administration timed positive energy announcements to coincide with the president's visit. ??At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, Bush was announcing the expansion of a program that provides federal money to help low-income residents pay for power. ??Bush was proposing $150 million, in addition to $300 million already budgeted for a component of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to provide special help to cash-strapped residents of California and certain Midwest areas such as Chicago, a senior administration aide said. ??Bush was also reminding state residents of his order that military facilities in the state cut peak-hour usage by 10 percent. ??To alleviate an electricity bottleneck on a crucial south-north transmission path, the Department of Energy announced that the Western Area Power Authority will try to raise money from a variety of private and public entities to finance a crucial additional lines. ??""The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,"" said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. ""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??Davis had a letter for Bush from top economists who maintain price caps are justified and necessary. ??Aides to the governor expressed amazement that Bush would travel all the way to California with no major announcement in hand, and predicted Davis would respond with ""polite rage."" ??Mindful of the national stage he commanded, Davis planned a news conference to air his grievances. And he convened a panel of families he said have been victimized by the energy crisis in the same hotel where Bush was staying. ??Davis wants Bush to pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose stiff price caps. ??Tuesday, limited caps ordered last month by FERC go into effect in California, but only when electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent in the state - a step Davis called inadequate. ??Protesters planned demonstrations in Los Angeles and at Camp Pendleton, in San Diego County. ??Bush also arranged a speech on energy and trade to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and planned to president over a closed-door energy round-table discussion.

Gray Davis was to meet President Bush to press for a federal cap on energy prices. ??But Davis wasn't expected to win any concessions during the 20-minute Tuesday meeting where he's expected to point to Texas energy makers. ??Davis has appeared on national news programs attacking Bush for opposing price controls on wholesale electricity, and suggesting the president has ignored price-gouging by Texas-based electricity generators. ??""The president did not create this problem, but he is uniquely situated to solve it,"" Davis said Monday. ""What I'm going to ask him to do, with all respect, is to enforce federal law. The money that leaves this state goes directly to energy companies in Texas and the Southwest."" ??If Bush refuses to administer price controls as expected, Davis can use that as ammunition in his sparring with the administration. ??Bush has blamed California officials for the state's power woes and said price controls won't solve shortages. Instead, they said, Bush plans to stress his efforts to conserve energy in federal buildings and will bring one or two new initiatives to the table. ??One of them commits the federal government to helping organize a consortium to build more power lines for the state. ??Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham directed the Western Area Power Administration, a federal agency, to take the first steps to clear the way for building more transmission capacity between southern and northern California. That would help relieve a transmission bottleneck in the central part of the state. ??While this will not help this summer, Abraham said in a statement the line improvements, when completed, ""will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??The stakes of the meeting are high for both politicians. ??Davis, who has been mentioned as a Democratic challenger to Bush in 2004, wants federal help to solve an energy crunch that threatens rolling outages this summer and has cost state taxpayers nearly $8 million since January - the price of buying power for two cash-starved private utilities. And his plan to rescue one of those companies reportedly is faltering. ??Leaders of both the state Senate and Assembly oppose a $3 billion-plus plan to bail out Southern California Edison by buying its power lines, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. ??Bush, meanwhile, needs to mend fences in vote-heavy California. The Republican president lost badly here in November, and polls show most Californians dislike his handling of their energy crisis. ??Bush's Tuesday agenda was heavy on energy issues. At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, Bush was to highlight his order that federal agencies and installations cut back energy use. Then it was on to Los Angeles to discuss his energy plan in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??Bush was confronted by the issue virtually as he stepped off the plane Monday in Los Angeles. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles, escorted the Academic Decathlon national championship team from El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills to meet Bush. He told the president California needs regulation of electric generators. ??""The president seems to believe just by instinct that rate regulation reduces supply and also by instinct that all those in the energy industry are fair people who are not trying to game the system,"" Sherman said. ""Anyone who studies the facts in California knows that power is being withheld in order to drive up the price.""

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable price-gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony, and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. Investigations Under Way About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' "" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay "" is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response."" Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above ""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: Agency ????Investigation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ????Whether generators are charging more than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act; whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General ????Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. PUC and California Independent System Operator ????Whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and, thus, to raise electricity prices. California Electricity Oversight Board ????Whether patterns of bidding and pricing in California's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. Sources: state and federal agencies Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. 'Forced Outage' Rate Rises Generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. ""Plants have been running flat out,"" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. ""Clearly, something is going on here."" However, he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee ""indicated"" to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was ""counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature"" in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" Write to John R.

Now California has power watches and power warnings to guide residents through days of summer blackouts. ??Beginning next week, forecasters who look at variables like electricity loads and transmission constraints instead of wind speeds and barometric pressure will lay the odds of blackouts being imposed the next day. If those odds appear to be 50-50 or greater, they will issue a power warning. ??In addition, the California Independent System Operator will issue 30-minute advisories to warn state residents that blackouts are probably imminent. ??The new warnings are in response to complaints that blackouts have taken people by surprise. ??""What we're hearing from the public is they wanted a little more heads-up when it comes to blackouts,"" said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. ??Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis was in Chicago Monday to hear firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. State lawmakers are exploring ways to provide Californians with greater notice of potential blackouts, including scheduling them in advance. ??In Chicago, where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers, residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming, and grid operators work with city agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??California's new warning system has considerable limits. ??The ISO, after all, does not determine where blackouts occur. They simply tell the three utilities in the system _ Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric _ when to shut off power and how much to turn off. ??It is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. ??PG&E's website posts which of 14 outage blocks is next to be hit, so anyone who knows their block number could use information from PG&E and the ISO websites to prepare for a blackout. ??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the Northern California utility can make tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities ""in a very short period of time."" ??""We think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given by the ISO . . . is a good thing,"" Nelson said, adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??In another development on Monday, state Controller Kathleen Connell issued another warning about the financial toll California's energy crisis is taking on the state treasury. Connell said the state could run out of cash by Sept. 1 if $ 13.4 billion in revenue bonds aren't sold. ??The state plans to sell the bonds in late August to cover the cost of buying electricity needed by financially troubled Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to serve their customers. ??Even if the bonds go through without a hitch, Connell said the state will have to seek more bonds or borrow between $3 billion and $5 billion beginning February 2002 to continue buying power. She said electricity purchases are costing the state more than the governor anticipated and far less has been bought through long-term contracts than Davis planned. ??But the governor's top energy aides challenged Connell's analysis and said they believe long-term contracts now being put in place combined with conservation efforts will bring spending down. Joe Fichera, a Davis financial adviser, said the state spent $1.8 billion to buy power in April, only 1.4 percent higher than the $1.78 billion estimated. ??""I think reasonable people can differ in terms of the projections,"" Fichera said. ""I don't know what's underlying all of her assumptions and such. We do have more complete information . . . ."" ??To highlight the exorbitant costs of power, Connell pointed to an enlarged picture of a $533 million check the state sent the Mirant Corp. for April power purchases. ??Mirant defended its sales. Included in its April sales were $126 million worth of electricity that the company bought from companies unwilling to sell to California but which Mirant purchased and then sold to California at a 12 percent markup, according to figures released by the company. ??""If the intent was to somehow attack Mirant for its role in the California market in April, then I'd have to say that the state has apparently decided to bite a helping hand,"" said Randy Harrison, CEO of Mirant's western U.S. operations. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Copley News Service News Service 22, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 1066 words HEADLINE: State sends $533.2 million to company, part of April bill BYLINE: Ed Mendel DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California, $533.2 million, went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month, April. ??Mirant, formerly Southern Energy, says more than half of the power came from three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan. ??State Treasurer Kathleen Connell, who displayed a blown-up copy of the check at a news conference yesterday, said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more than the $13.4 billion planned. ??Connell, an elected official who issues state checks, said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday, totaling $5.1 billion, provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity ''is dropping and that it will continue to drop through the summer.'' ??But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state, which has more long-term contracts than Connell has seen, is on track to control power costs with the aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing. ??''I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario,'' said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, a Davis consultant. ''It's the expected scenario.'' ??The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases, about $7 billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers. ??Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids. A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force disclosure. ??Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She declined to release details of the contracts, saying they are complicated and have varying prices. ??Connell said the check for $533,181,235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the largest she has written since taking office in 1995. ??''This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices,'' Connell said, ''even though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases power) has an executed long-term contract with this company.'' ??Mirant said in a statement that, at the request of the state, its marketing arm gave the state a ''helping hand'' by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state. ??''We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf,'' said Randy Harrison, Mirant's Western chief executive officer, ''and it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative light.'' ??Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April, while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours. ??The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour. That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive spot market during the second quarter of this year, from April through June. ??But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the state. ??Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3,000 megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost power to California. ??The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than 20,000 megawatts. The largest group of plants, 4,700 megawatts, went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing 7,000 megawatts. ??The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts, although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state. More heat means more air conditioning, and a greater strain on the system. ??But starting next month, the state's electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts. ??The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site ''power warnings'' when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a ''power watch'' when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand days. ??The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities to cut power to customers, posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site. Its Web site address is www.caiso.com. ??''There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's what we are trying to do,'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ??O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out, including whether e-mails or pagers might be used. ??In other developments in the electricity crisis: ???About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to 375,000 households as part of the ''Power Walk'' program that began during the weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million conservation program. ???Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore as communication consultants for $30,000 a month. The Republicans said Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate ''a partisan, cut-throat political communications firm.'' ???The state auditor general said in a report on energy deregulation that the state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about 20 percent of its power.

Rose DATELINE: SAN DIEGO BODY: ??San Dieg Gas and Electric's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity. ??At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday, some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers. ??''We need rates we can depend on,'' said John Roberts, who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos. ??SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation, and the utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state passed a 6.5-cent per kilowatt hour cap. ??The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of PG&E and Edison, which are about 3 cents per kilowatt hour higher. ??Yesterday's hearing, however, was for commercial rates. ??Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year, while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition, he said. ??Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive. ??''If businesses leave the state, they'll be without jobs, and a $30 savings on their power bills won't mean much,'' Roberts said. ??The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30 people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center, 330 N. Coast Highway. ??Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases.

""Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest."" ??Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. ??On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ??""California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,"" the letter said. ??Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will ""serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators."" ??""The Republicans,"" Lehane added, ""ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here."" ??Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ??""There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,"" Davis' campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. ??Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. ??After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. ??Davis emerged from the meeting saying ""the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout."" ??It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. ??* ??Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), and the city of Oakland. ??""A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California,"" the draft says. ""The public health, safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices."" ??Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats ??Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity since January. ??In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people ""are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed."" ??""Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men, women and children with disabilities,"" the suit says. ""They represent an imminent threat to life, health and independence."" ??Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC. ??Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit. ??""Let's face it,"" said Kelso, a Republican, ""this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months."" ??Watching the Water Supply ??The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to consumers. ??""If the water looks cloudy or dirty,"" the warning says, ""you should not drink it."" The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality, they can boil it or add ""eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes."" ??Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that ""if an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system.""

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, NANCY VOGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer, courtesy of the energy crisis: ""The 405 Freeway is jammed, there's a slim chance of showers, and oh, by the way, there's a 50% likelihood of blackouts."" ??By the end of this month, the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected. ??It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses, government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable blackout in their area. ??Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air, but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than 10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers. ??Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses, particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of electricity. ??If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's, Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making increased notification crucial. ??With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700 megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer. ??""The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them, they will check in,"" said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who serves on the Cal-ISO board. ??Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday. But a Web page called ""Today's Outlook"" on the agency's Internet site, http://www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour, how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall. ??Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergency that is expected. ??A ""power watch"" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages, and a more serious ""power warning"" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3, which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.) ??Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media, Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on ""blast lists,"" or massive computer databases that it will assemble. ??""The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we should be deploying high-tech solutions,"" said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification. ""Every time California goes black, the economy sees red."" ??Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react. ??""A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public,"" he said. ??Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most of the warnings, Florio said residents also will benefit. ??""It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners, but if someone works at home, and sets it up to get an e-mail notice, they can take advantage,"" he said. ??In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California's power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4 billion more before it runs out of cash in February. ??Calling a news conference in the capital, state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis' financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4 billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and cover future power buys for the next two years. ??Connell's opinion is notable because, as the state's chief check writer, the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret. ??Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's warnings.

Long commutes. Mediocre schools. Housing costs. At the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, the Valley's answer to Central Park, such ordinary concerns about money, time and resources stretched too thin for comfort tumbled out again and again during interviews with some two dozen people visiting this green oasis. ??Sprawling northwest from the tangled junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways, the recreation area is a pastoral patchwork of three golf courses bracketed by Woodley Avenue Park to the east and Lake Balboa to the west. It hardly looks like a battleground, but the 2,000-acre park straddles something of a political fault line in the mayoral contest. ??Both candidates in the June 5 runoff, former state legislator Antonio Villaraigosa and City Atty. James K. Hahn, have staked out the Valley as prime campaign turf, packed with thousands of up-for-grabs voters whose affections might well tip the race. ??And the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is wedged between an electoral no man's land--a southern ribbon of the Valley where about 60% of voters shunned both men in the election's first round--and a central Valley region where Villaraigosa took first place in April, beating Hahn by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. ??Between them, the candidates are expected to spend more than $10 million by election day to get their messages out. But it's not clear whether these impassioned appeals are reaching their intended targets. ??Less than a month before the election, many people here are preoccupied with concerns that have little to do with City Hall. And when they do voice interest in local matters, some seem unable to connect these issues to a candidate. ??For instance, several Valley voters interviewed in the park in early May said that knotted traffic on the San Diego Freeway was a major problem. But no one mentioned a plan Villaraigosa unveiled in March to buy hundreds of new buses and slash fares in a sweeping bid to cut vehicle traffic, or a proposal from Hahn to add more carpool lanes on freeways. ??Which raises a fundamental challenge for would-be mayors: Sometimes, there's just too much going on in everyday life to tune in to city politics. ""I know I ought to,"" many people confess sheepishly, ""but I just haven't gotten around to it yet."" ??Take Randye Sandel, 58, a blond and bespectacled oil painter from Valley Village. Sandel said she plans to vote for Hahn, ""a known quantity"" in City Hall, but a moment later admits that she might change her mind. The thing is, Sandel adds, she's been really busy setting up an art exhibition at a Santa Monica gallery and has yet to research her mayoral options. ""I've been totally immersed in my own life,"" she said. ??Same goes for Harold Seay, a muscular golfer heading back to his car after playing 18 holes. The 44-year-old music teacher from Encino said he's had his hands full for weeks rehearsing graduation recitals for a Brentwood private school. ""The news is the last thing I'm paying attention to,"" he said. ??But both voters can easily rattle off their most pressing concerns. Sandel, who used to teach art at Valley College, said she is particularly worried about education. ??""The last few semesters I taught, I was horrified by the academic preparedness of the students. They were practically illiterate,"" she said. ""They couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. That bothers me a lot. Who's going to inherit this country?"" ??Seay, who recently moved to Los Angeles from Miami, said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. Seay is African American and his wife is Italian, he said, and their 9-year-old daughter is ""stuck half-and-half,"" caught in what Seay regards as a troubling black-white divide. ""That black-white thing really turns me off,"" he said. ""I care about people getting along."" ??As the mayoral race hurtles into its final weeks, some of Hahn and Villaraigosa's most spirited skirmishes have erupted over crime and law enforcement issues. Each man is trying to burnish his own crime-fighting credentials while accusing his rival of neglecting public safety. ??The candidates have squabbled especially fiercely over compressed work schedules for police officers--the notion of squashing the police workweek into three 12-hour days, or possibly four 10-hour days. The Police Protective League endorsed Hahn, who supports the so-called 3-12 schedule favored by the union. Villaraigosa, whom Hahn has often characterized as soft on crime, seized upon the scheduling issue to retaliate, arguing that the three-day week would jeopardize public safety. ??But interviews with people visiting the Valley's biggest park revealed that crime--which has declined significantly since Mayor Richard Riordan took office eight years ago--was not the main issue weighing on these voters' minds. That distinction belongs to something that has walloped wallets far and wide across this car-addled city: the soaring price of gasoline. ??As he cooled down after a six-mile run near Balboa Lake, Ray Verdugo summed up the problem facing many gas-guzzlers as prices approached $2 a gallon: ""I made a big mistake and bought a big SUV,"" lamented the retired Rocketdyne engineer from Winnetka. ""I'm on a fixed income, and [gasoline prices] keep going up all the time."" ??Big-city mayors, to be sure, wield minimal influence over gasoline pumps. Gas prices are swayed by market forces, including the international cost of crude oil, rising demand and limited refinery capacity. Nonetheless, about a third of voters interviewed as they ambled around the Sepulveda Basin named gas prices as a top concern. Half as many said they were worried about crime. ??Some voters said they were troubled by California's electricity woes, although Los Angeles residents have been spared shortages and blackouts because the city's municipal utility avoided deregulation. ??""I think building more power plants would help,"" said Julie Erickson, 27, a figure-skating instructor from Reseda. ??And then there are the things that people aren't talking about. Nobody (at least nobody in an admittedly unscientific sample of voters culled over two days in the Sepulveda Basin) mentioned the Rampart police scandal or the recruiting problems crippling the Los Angeles Police Department. ??No one uttered so much as a peep about neighborhood councils, that much-ballyhooed innovation of the new city charter. Even the Valley secession movement--which Villaraigosa has pointed to as ""the biggest challenge facing Los Angeles""--hardly earned an honorable mention from this cross-section of Valleyites. Only one voter referred to secession at all, saying that she favored it. ??Instead, many people voiced personal gripes, the kind of woes unlikely to vault to the center of the mayoral radar screen--but issues that nonetheless embody the high quality of life both candidates envision for Los Angeles. ??One man, a sunburned golfer who lives in Van Nuys, said he's dismayed that the city hasn't finished building a new golf clubhouse and restaurant at the Woodley Lakes Golf Course. Another frequent park visitor, a retired housekeeper from Sherman Oaks, complained about the windblown litter she sees as she walks her dog around Balboa Lake. ??But some problems vexing these voters seem frankly beyond the grasp of even the most poll-tested candidate. ??Sandel, the oil painter, got downright metaphysical after a good 15 minutes spent mulling the troubles facing Los Angeles, and indeed the world. Technology, she concluded, was advancing so rapidly that it was crowding out humanity's intuitive, spiritual side. ??""I think there's an extraordinary sense of collective despair and psychological uncertainty smoldering just below the surface,"" she said. ""I don't know what City Hall can do about that."" GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Ray Verdugo, a retired Rocketdyne engineer, says, ""I'm on a fixed income, and [gas prices] keep going up all the time.""

The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utility companies to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utility companies also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utility companies and is difficult for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators, and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment fret that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 the ISO will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. It will issue a 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts begin but will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana (Orange County), who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices, called the ""ramping"" allegations, first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday, ""outrageous acts of manipulation."" ???Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law, legislation could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future. ???""We're looking at it, yes, from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced to render it a violation for future such acts."" ???Dunn's committee already has been investigating charges that power generators ""gamed"" the wholesale energy market to boost their profits. ???The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants, sometimes several times within an hour. ???Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity. The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts, which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour. The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants, leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants. ???The senate committee, which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California, has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power-generating companies. Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine which plants employed the ramping tactic. He added that the issue would be examined in a public hearing in the coming weeks. ???Meanwhile, pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year. ???Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission, which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns, has narrowed its focus. It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offline during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies. ???Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal. However, Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diego-area plant co-owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston and NRG Inc. of Minneapolis. Another was a Pittsburg plant owned by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. The companies denied the allegations. ???On another front, Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County), were expected to file a lawsuit this morning against the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee for failing to carry out its stated duty of ensuring ""just and reasonable"" electricity rates. ???""Their central failing is that they don't follow the law,"" Burton said in an interview.

""When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes' warning. Two minutes may be fine in a football game, but it's not fine for California's economy or safety."" ???ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ???The plan, detailed in a report issued yesterday, still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a ""buyer's cartel"" that would refuse to pay for power when prices become too high. ???""It's not the report I was expecting, but 30 minutes of notice is certainly better than two,"" said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray. ""No matter how you slice it, this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery."" ???A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21.8 billion, said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses. ???""In this electrically unreliable world, any notification manufacturers can get is good,"" said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the association. ""While 30 minutes won't be enough for some, for most manufacturers it will be sufficient."" The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmakers regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts, said Michael Florio, an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network. ???""There are bigger public policy ramifications,"" Florio said. ???The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the changes are just updates of policies already in place. ???WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS ???The 30-minute advance-notification system, scheduled to go into effect early next month, would warn of ""probable"" blackouts, including the amount of load that will have to be curtailed in each service area. ???Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ???The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. ???This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations, said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ???Also planned by the ISO is a ""Power Watch/Power Warning"" system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days. ???Under the two-tiered system, a ""Power Watch"" would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely, while a ""Power Warning"" would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage Three alert. ???With one report suggesting California may see as many as 700 hours of rolling blackouts this summer, lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to make the outages easier for power customers to cope with. ???The idea of a buyer's cartel, the subject of a Capitol hearing today, would have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one dime more. ???The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity. ???The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand. ???The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in, supporters said. ???DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS ???Meanwhile, Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, will introduce a bill today that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block. ???For example, a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 if blackouts are needed that day. ???""Right now, every day is a potential blackout day,"" Briggs said. ""This way people would know when their potential days are."" ??On alert ???-- When demand is high, the ISO will forecast peak demand, power supply and weather 24 hours in advance. ???-- A ""power watch"" will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Stage 1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is within 5% of running out of power). ???-- A ""power warning"" will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of a Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply). ???Who calls a blackout? ???Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity, the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes' notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut. ???Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long? ???A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers into 14 blocks; each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography. Thus, neighborhoods in San Francisco, Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously. ???Q: How many users are blacked out at once? ???A: Each of PG&E's 14 ???blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1,000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550 megawatts, it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can black out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for less than 550 megawatts. ???Q: How is power shut off? ???A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand. ???Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected? ???A: A total of 3,035,000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan. 1, 2001. ???Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next? ???A: Some or all customers in Block 1. ???Q: How do I know what block I'm in? ???A: Look for the words ""Rotating Outage Block"" followed by a number on your bill. If it says Block 50, you share an electrical circuit with a hospital, police station or other ""essential service"" that is normally exempt from service cuts. ???Q: What should I do when the lights go out? ???A: Power experts advise: ???-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surges when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electricity is back. ???-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all intersections as a four-way stop. ???-- To protect food, open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary. ???-- Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles, observe the usual safety precautions. ???-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if only your home is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. ???-- When the power returns, turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges. ???-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. ???-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, to turn off the TV and computers, and not to use candles. ???Sources: PG&E, Chronicle staff ???Chronicle Graphic ??E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

""And he's got to stop looking so cozy with business."" ??The president's proposal emphasizes stepped-up production and modest conservation measures. It received mixed reviews from an anxious public that appears to want quick relief but sees the plan only helping after several years. ??Although Bush says his program will allow Americans to retain the lifestyle they are accustomed to, only 30% of those surveyed said they believe it. Two of three said major lifestyle changes will be necessary to solve the nation's energy woes. ??Nearly half said the Bush plan would not do enough to conserve energy, and 43% said the plan would do too little to increase production. ??Americans also were split over the Bush proposal to increase the number of nuclear power plants to generate electricity: 49% for and 46% against. ??The tepid response to the Bush energy plan might have been a factor in raising his job-disapproval rating from 31% a week ago to 36% now, the highest of his presidency. His 56% job-approval rating did not change from a week ago. ??Bush's strongest disapproval came from Democrats, low-income earners, women under 50 and residents of California, a state wrestling with electricity shortages. ??California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was highly critical of the Bush plan. He said it ""does nothing to address the astronomical run-up in the prices of electricity, natural gas and gasoline (and) favors more energy production at the expense of everything else."" ??White House spokesman Claire Buchan said the president will continue to press his plan, regardless of the polls: ""The president does not govern by polls. This is a serious issue that has been neglected for years, and he has begun a serious dialogue with the American people. It will continue."" ??Most poll respondents said they see threats of electricity shortages and the rising price of gasoline and heating fuels as serious problems, although only 12% said they see a ""state of crisis."" And most of those polled said Bush is not doing enough to address those problems. ??At the same time, most said energy companies have too much influence over the administration's energy polices, an argument Democrats raise. ??One in five said the Bush administration deserves a great deal of blame for the energy problems; 28% put a great deal of that blame on the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather, the traffic and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday that it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30, it will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warnings to the media and others before any blackouts begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. ""Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do."" ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends.

The plant, owned by local power wholesaler Pinnacle West Energy, will produce enough electricity to serve about 120,000 homes, though much of it may be sold elsewhere. ??On Monday, PG&E National Energy Group, a sister of California's financially squeezed PG&E Gas and Electric, broke ground for its planned $500 million generating plant west of Phoenix that will use natural gas. ??It's one of up to 11 plants planned for Arizona by out-of-state interests. Three such plants are expected to begin production this summer, though much of their power also may be sold to other states. ??That's true of the PG&E National plant, too, but those who live in the vicinity don't care. ??""We have nothing out here now,"" said Elisa Bigbey of Harquahala Valley. ""We want to get something going."" ??The plant will increase the assessed valuation of the area by 17 times and will generate $10.7 million in new property taxes. PG&E already has given the local school district a portable shed in which to store records because the district's only school was damaged by a November fire. ??PG&E also is making a no-strings outright gift to the community of $550,000 in 11 annual cash installments. A committee of local residents will decide how to spend the windfall. ??Meanwhile, Panda Energy of Dallas and Teco Power Services of Tampa, Fla., recently broke ground for a plant south of the PG&E site, and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C., and Sempra Energy of San Diego each have started plants in the Arlington Valley. ??Pinnacle West Generating has a plant under construction near the Palo Verde nuclear plant in this same general area. ??Additionally, the Desert Basin Plant in Casa Grande is owned by Reliant Energy of Houston. The Griffith Energy Plant near Kingman is owned by Duke Energy and P&L Global. The Southpoint plant, set to begin production next month near Bullhead City, is owned by Calpine Corp. of San Jose. ??Such plants have come to Arizona because there's lot of space in Arizona, water is relatively inexpensive, there's access to natural gas, regulators are friendly and the plants can be situated at a distance from urban air pollution controls. ??The PG&E plant will produce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides that can lead to formation of ozone, an air pollution problem against Phoenix has been fighting for years. ??Additionally, the plant will use 6,500 acre feet of water a year, enough to meet the needs of a town of about 30,000. PG&E expects to use surplus Central Arizona Project water from the distant Colorado River - but the Harquahala Valley has a good supply of underground water PG&E can tap if the CAP surplus disappears.

The Independent System Operator will also be issuing a daily energy forecast with projected supply and demand, and the likelihood of blackouts. Several lawmakers say they'll introduce plans that would give Californians even more notice of blackouts - from one day to one month. ??- The state auditor releases a report on the state's energy crisis, saying previous estimates that the state could avoid blackouts this summer are overly optimistic. The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission, saying the commission hasn't responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line project. ??- Gov. Gray Davis is in Chicago, speaking with city officials there about blackout procedures. ??- Davis' energy advisers say that the state is meeting its energy goals, despite doubts raised by Controller Kathleen Connell and other critics. Connell questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheap enough to avoid borrowing more than the $13.4 billion approved by state lawmakers. But Davis adviser Joe Fichera says the state has signed more long-term power contracts that will help keep prices low. ??- Davis' office announces that an eighth ""peaker"" power plant has been licensed. The 135-megawatt plant in Gilroy is expected to be online by the end of September. The California Energy Commission says that more than 10,000 megawatts of new electricity since April 1999. ??- The California Energy Commission also announces increased rebates for renewable energy systems - such as solar panels, fuel cells or small wind generation. Rebates of up to 50 percent on the system are available for residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural users. ??- Republican legislative leaders criticize Davis for spending tax money on a political communications firm that previously advised Vice President Al Gore. Davis is hiring Gore's former press secretary and deputy campaign manager for six months at $30,000 a month to coordinate the governor's communications on energy issues. Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte and Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox say Davis should pay them with campaign funds, not taxpayers' money. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $11.23, down 51 cents. PG&E Corp. dropped 48 cents to close at $11.16. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. ??- Davis is scheduled to sign a bill Tuesday that would expedite power plant siting. ??- Republican Assemblyman Mike Briggs plans to introduce a bill that would allow people to know a month ahead if they will be affected by rolling blackouts. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 36 percent for residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

It is at once a triumph of technology and Western gumption, and a reminder of how tenuous it all is. ??The great growth in the West followed a simple recipe: Water plus power equals population. There was always a feeling that the land was so big you couldn't use it up, not the resources, not the space. ??Today there are signs that's no longer true. In California, blackouts. In Oregon and Washington, drought. In Arizona, arsons to stop construction. And in every rearview mirror, more traffic all the time. ??The allure of vast prairies, open skies and endless opportunity is what first drew people out West. But as deserts disappear under development, possibilities become problems. ??Now, with its infrastructure strained by growth, the West faces difficult choices: Energy or environment? Freeways or orchards? Water for people or fish? ??""We're losing what we've come for, this ideal,"" says James Corless, California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, which aims to diversify transportation systems to reduce traffic and pollution caused by growth. ""And we are loath to change."" ??--- ??When the streets went dark in California, a light bulb came on across the West. ??The region saw its vulnerability. For one very important resource, demand had won out over supply. What about all the others? ??""We've got an infrastructure that can't really carry much additional power. We're starting to see the same situation with water,"" says John Maddox, president of the Denver-based Center for the New West. ??And people keep coming. ??The West added more than 10 million people in the 1990s, making it the fastest-growing region in the United States. In the next decade, another 10 million are expected. ??""What does that mean?"" Maddox says. ""How many new roads, new water infrastructure and treatment facilities, how many new runways and airports?"" ??Perhaps more than clogged freeways and periodic droughts, the power crisis has brought home the reality that there are limits to growth. ??In California, electricity consumption rose 24 percent in the past five years as the economy grew by 29 percent. However, no major new plants were built in the state in the past 10 years, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ??Several projects to generate new power were shelved in the 1990s, because of regulatory red-tape, environmental protests, economics and wariness over the state's deregulation plan. ??As a result, the power ran low and California was forced to go to the open market in search of electricity, sending power rates soaring and shutting out the lights in rolling blackouts. ??California officials now predict it will take two to three years before energy production catches up with demand. ??Meanwhile, the crisis has crossed state lines. In the Northwest, generating capacity grew 4 percent in the 1990s, while demand grew 24 percent. That wasn't a problem when abundant rain and snow produced above-average hydropower generation between 1995 and 2000. ??Then drought hit, and generation dropped. Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana are about 3,000 megawatts short of the electricity they need. ??Now everyone's playing catch-up. California is on a plant-building spree, while other states are pushing conservation and looking for alternative fuel sources. ??Even in power-hungry Las Vegas, the mega-resorts are cutting back. The MGM Grand refitted its 5,000 guest rooms with low-watt fluorescent bulbs and changed its casino-floor lighting. Treasure Island's parking garage is switching to sodium bulbs that use 30 percent less energy. ??But a feeling of dread is gripping some Westerners. If the lights can go out, what's next? Dry faucets? ??""The thing I worry about is water,"" says Carol Ann Heggie-Hall, a retired science teacher who moved from Queens, N.Y., to Henderson, Nev., in 1999. ""Is there enough water for everyone and their plants?"" ??Much of the West is facing the worst drought in a quarter-century, prompting warnings of environmental degradation, forest fires and agricultural decline. Nevertheless, experts say the West isn't in danger of running out of water. The challenge is determining who gets how much. ??""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if the faucets ran dry in Scottsdale, there are places to go to get water,"" says Joe Hunter, a power and water specialist at the Center for the New West. ""But it means shifting it from one use to another."" ??About 80 percent of water in most Western states is used to irrigate crops, a percentage that could drop if residential supplies were strained, Hunter says. ??Western states and cities must also do more to share water. ??California has long used more than its allocation from the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to seven Western states. An agreement allows California to receive surplus water if it implements conservation measures that will reduce its reliance on the river in the future. ??In the meantime, Western cities are looking elsewhere to sustain the supply. The Las Vegas Valley predicts it will reach its annual Colorado River allocation by 2007, so its regional water authority is negotiating to store 1.2 million acre feet of water in Arizona for the next 15 years. ??Beyond power and water, other infrastructure problems persist. In the Vegas area, which added 700,000 people in the '90s, road closures due to highway expansions are a daily occurrence. ??""There are few roads you can drive on that aren't under construction,"" admits Jim Gibson, mayor of Henderson, a city south of Vegas that is among the country's most rapidly growing communities. ??Without the new roads, Vegas transportation officials estimate there would be 2,289 miles of congestion by the year 2025, compared with 341 miles last year. ??Highways alleviate congestion, but also drive more growth. ??Interstate 5, the north-south freeway through Washington and Oregon, became a growth magnet. In Colorado, Interstate 70 has opened the mountains to staggering growth west of Denver. ??-- ??In the fastest-growing metro area in the fastest-growing state in the fastest-growing region of the country, Greg Cox and Dale Stark are unloading dirt on a Las Vegas street crammed with construction workers. ??The landscapers are a rare breed in a town teeming with newcomers: Cox has lived here all his life; Stark moved from Southern California in 1979. ??Both grumble about the changes they've seen, and both vow to leave. ??""I moved here when this town was nice,"" Stark says. ""Now you can't drive down the road without getting cut off and flipped off."" ??Cox complains he can barely get around at all. A drive across town used to take 20 minutes. Now, he grunts, ""You've got to pack a lunch."" ??Both agree: Even Las Vegas, the city built on the very idea of unlimited resources and space, is reaching its limits. ??The sentiment is spreading across the West: Unbridled growth must stop. ??Planning experts insist cities must reinvest in old neighborhoods rather than build new ones, and provide incentive to plan for growth in a way that incorporates existing infrastructure. ??Portland, Ore., has been a national leader with its urban growth boundary. In San Francisco, a program provides federal money to developers who build homes near transit stops. ??Still, when initiatives to rein in growth were placed on the ballot in several Western states last November, most of the big measures failed - including one in Arizona to force developers to pay for new infrastructure. Opponents warned that growth controls would be bad for business. ??In Las Vegas, despite infrastructure challenges, the official line remains that growth is good. ??""As long as you can take care of the social problems and quality of life problems, there's never such a thing as too much growth,"" declares Mayor Oscar Goodman. ""Once you stop growing, you stagnate."" ??And so for now, the fountains flow, the marquees shine. ??And the people keep coming. ??On the Net: ??Center for the New West: www.newwest.org/ ??Sierra Club sprawl campaign: ??Census stats: ??Las Vegas growth topics website: ??Surface Transportation Policy Project: http://www.transact.org/ ??Brookings Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy: ??EDITOR'S NOTE - Pauline Arrillaga is the AP's Southwest regional writer, based in Phoenix. ??End ADV for May 26-27 GRAPHIC: AP Photos NY372-375 of May 21, AP Graphic WESTERN GROWTH, AP LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News; Business News LENGTH: 648 words HEADLINE: California will forecast blackouts and warn the public BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather, the traffic - and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators, and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30, it will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. ""Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do."" ??Assemblyman Fred Keeley, the Legislature's point man on energy, acknowledged that scheduling blackouts could attract criminals and open the state to legal liability for accidents at blacked-out intersections. ??""That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,"" Keeley said earlier. ""I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately."" ??The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends. ??State Assemblyman Mike Briggs said he plans to introduce a bill that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??""We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,"" Briggs said.

Gray Davis and the economy has plunged in the face of a statewide energy crisis, according to a poll released Monday. ??""This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders,"" said Mark Baldassare, director of the survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??The institute, a nonprofit organization that researches economic, social and political issues, interviewed 2,001 adult California residents, in English and Spanish, between May 1 and May 9.

Forty-four percent believe it is on the right track. ??The poll also found that Californians blame the electric utility companies more than anyone else for the energy crunch. Thirty-two percent said they fault utilities, while 26 percent blame former Gov.

And if generators don't lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he said. ??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the state's current method of ""highly disruptive random rolling blackouts"" needs to be revamped. ??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration. ??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. ??""That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,"" Keeley said. ""I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately."" ??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies short. ??Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??""We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,"" Briggs said. ""If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly."" ??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops. ??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. ??Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. ??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said. California power consumers would in essence form ""a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging,"" she said. ??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash-strapped privately owned utilities. ??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point last week. ??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 years. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com/ LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 901 words HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities. ??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills, and near the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills, is a number called baseline, which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge. ??This number, which differs from customer to customer based on a host of factors, is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history start showing up on bills. ??""Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher, it's going to require that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do when long distance telephone service was deregulated,"" said Commissioner Carl Wood of the Public Utilities Commission. ??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC, everyone who exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 percent average hike on their overall bill, translating to an increase of roughly $85 a month. ??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30 percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around half of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category. ??But consumer rights groups, and even the utilities, think the PUC is underestimating residential electric use, given the recent proliferation of home computers, cell phone chargers and the like. ??They think baseline is set too low for many customers, and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes. ??""It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying within baseline,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. ""A rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large households."" ??Since 1982, when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation, the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions. ??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and central California; Edison has six in central and southern California. ??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount, and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction, breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey, given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??Since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely, economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??""Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, Florio said. ""Does PG&E come by and do bed checks?"" ??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since January, the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. ??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president Loretta Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??""There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,"" Wood said. ??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years, ""living standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was,"" Wood said. ??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers. There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??Add that to increased conservation statewide, Florio said, and there's a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes. ??""It's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy more efficiently,"" through the years, Florio said. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??Pacific Gas and Electric Co.: http://www.pge.com ??Southern California Edison Co.: http://www.sce.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 273 words HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed in the wrong direction. ??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, according to a new poll. ??The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.

Headlines proclaimed a ""crisis,"" and legislative leaders shifted into an ""I told you so"" mode. ??Hold the phone. ??This is not California. There is no crisis. Customers with interruptible service contracts have always been subject to cutoffs in times of peak consumption or when generators are down. ??It may not be fair to suggest that Alliant Energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law, but the timing is nonetheless convenient. The Legislature is set to convene a special session in a few weeks, and among the business left over from the regular session could be a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating plants. ??While crisis is not imminent, Iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... ??While Iowa's law may need some ""streamlining,"" which could be dealt with in a special session, that should not be the end of the matter. Ultimately, the Legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes a regional view of energy, that reflects new market and regulation realities, and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. ??Legislative session: ??TELEGRAPH HERALD ??Even after a marathon legislative session - this one lasted 121 days - why does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??This year's session started out strong, passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. It finished up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. ??But just what happened in those middle 100 or so days is a little murky. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall, the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... ??-Legislators didn't get around to a ... bill to close a loophole in Iowa's Open Records law. The way it stands now, a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-The Legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate, so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... The issue of fairness needs to be addressed. ??Floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax, while racetracks pay a gradually increasing tax that now stands at 30 percent. Under the law enacted in 1997, that tax will grow to 36 percent by 2004. ??-Other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to include: cutting state income tax on Social Security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. ??So the 2002 Legislature will have its work cut out for it. Here are some jobs for next year's to-do list: ??-Amend the Open Records Law. Allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. ??-Carry the ball on increasing teachers' pay. The $40 million shot in the arm will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-Freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. The disparity between racetracks and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??And if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate, lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before May. ??IOWA CITY PRESS-CITIZEN: ??We agree with Gov. Tom Vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators ""will cause hardship for people and families across our state."" ??That's what happens when you face a $300 million revenue shortfall, and you don't have as much money as you wanted. ??But we disagree that ""for 3 1/2 months, they did very little."" ??On the contrary, Vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark of this session - $40 million for teacher pay raises and a new system for teacher pay. ??And the Republican-led Legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities, long a goal of Vilsack's Democratic Party. ??Are we happy with the budget? No. ??Is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? Yes. ??Vilsack should sign budget legislation, rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the Legislature this summer. ... ??Plant Sciences Institute: ??DES MOINES REGISTER: ??Iowa needs more people, especially young people. Iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses, small and large, to spring up here. So why did Iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??They blame it on a tight budget. Blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. The fledgling Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 Legislature provided no new money. ??It did continue the $4.67 million approved in 2000. It did not add $3 million, a meager increase proposed by the governor. It allowed ISU to keep money from the sale of land, with proceeds to be used for the institute's Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory, to be completed by 2002. It should have added at least $10 million in cash. ... ??Because of legislative inaction, promising initiatives must slow down, or may never take place. ... ??The institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??Ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... Such a facility might extract protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals, food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. The Plant Sciences Institute has a small, pilot protein-extraction facility. New money from the Legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. But now? ""The people interested in this will probably go elsewhere,"" said Director Stephen Howell. ??Why wouldn't they? Plenty of other states are serious about fostering biotech industries. The Iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??Iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. Investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to make Iowa's economy and population grow. Stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??Ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. The question should be what sort of future will Iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the Plant Sciences Institute holds. ??Hunting requirements: ??AMES TRIBUNE: ??In April, the Iowa House and Senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the Department of Natural Resources, saying it was ""just another hassle,"" for hunters. ??Then, the House hiked the fees for hunting licenses, in some cases up to 218 percent. A non-resident who wants to hunt deer in Iowa under this plan will have to shell out $308, including a hunting license and habitat fee. The current total is $156. ??Hassle? You got it. We might as well hang a sign on Iowa borders that says we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here, either. Add to the mix a federal whammy in the Freedom to Farm Act, which has all but eliminated any fence rows, and hunting as a potential tourism draw to Iowa blows away in the wind. ... ??Instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations, Department of Natural Resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??Surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration, and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??The DNR asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries, travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. And we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. ??We also would allow that some of the increases do not seem to us to be egregious. A $3 fish habitat fee for instance, isn't a great deal to pay. Nor is a $30 tab for a non-resident 7-day fishing license out of line. ??But some fee hikes were too much. ??In particular, the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states, and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. Wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. Missouri charges $125. License fees in Iowa are likely to result in less money coming in, not more. What out-of-state hunter will be drawn to Iowa when surrounding states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??Iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. We wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. We say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. Yet these votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??Public official recruits: ??QUAD-CITY TIMES: ??More Iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents, but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??In effect, it allows private firms to dictate public policy, and that's troubling. ??One example of this trend is the Camanche School District, where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently. They met with school board members, district staff and some residents, yet the board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. The Cedar Rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??Headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. Under Iowa law, a public entity such as a school board must honor such a request. ??Some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??Those arguments aren't justified, for reasons including: ??-There is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. Indeed, being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-Identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information, critical or supportive, that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-And being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??We prefer a process similar to one used by the City of Clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. The five finalists were not only identified, they took part in an open house to meet the public. A headhunter firm was used, but City Attorney Bruce Johansen, himself a candidate who did not get the job, said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names should be made public. ??We applaud that effort ... ??Meanwhile, the Iowa Legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. The change would require that official communication between private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. Whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??We encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect July 1. ??Train service: ??CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: ??Who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal Department of Human Services last winter might affect whether Davenport, Iowa City and Des Moines get rail service. ??But consider that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, who resigned recently from the Amtrak board, had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the Midwest while he was governor of Wisconsin. Thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the Amtrak board after he went to Washington. But the Associated Press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the Amtrak board says only one of the seven seats can be held by a member of the Cabinet - and the Bush administration wants Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta on the governing board. ??Few people around are as passionate as Thompson about Amtrak, and Iowa could have benefited. It's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of Iowans live. Maybe the service will be expanded here. But maybe, with the changes in the governing board, that train has already left the station. ??Smoker identification: ??LE MARS DAILY SENTINAL: ??Have you heard the news from Walgreen's?

Within a year, they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. Until then, they're asking their clerks to card everybody. Good for them. ... ??Yes, it will take a little extra time ... Evidently, the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??A convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate Walgreen's efforts. Yes. We certainly hope so. ??We all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco, of underage users ... Many, if not most of us, know someone who hacks and coughs, who died from smoking, who cries because someone died from smoking. When you think of them, it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. It seems downright brilliant. ... ??It won't stop it entirely. Young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older do the buying, or swipe a carton. There will always be a way to get around it, there always is. ??Still, carding everyone says, ""This is important, we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you.""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MARK HAINES, CNBC ANCHOR, SQUAWK BOX: One company that is hurting a lot in all this is PG&E, the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric. They filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. PG&E has about $9 billion in unrecovered power costs. A California bankruptcy judge says the company cannot raise retail rates to recoup those losses. The stock is on a steep decline this year, trading in the 52 week range of 6 to 32, last at about 11 1/2. Joining us to tell us where things are now and where they could be going, Robert Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO. Mr. Glynn, good to see you again. ROBERT GLYNN, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PG&E: Good morning, Mark. HAINES: So where do we stand now? GLYNN: Well, we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding, where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves and our creditors. We have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who, after all, need to get paid. HAINES: So let's first talk about time. How much time do you think this might take before PG&E emerges from bankruptcy? GLYNN: Well, it's very hard to tell for one reason. There have not been very many utility bankruptcies and I don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. The shortest possible time or shortest likely time that I've heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. The longest that I've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than I want it to take. HAINES: In the meantime you are selling electricity, transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. Are you still losing money on your operating? GLYNN: Well, the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the California independent system operator is still buying on behalf of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. And that's an issue that's before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for decision making right now. HAINES: Well, I guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? GLYNN: Well, the electric rates in California have just been raised by the California Public Utilities Commission in order to have the state, the Department of Water Resources be able to recover all of its costs because that's what, of course, it wants to do. It doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. So this most recent large rate increase has applied, as best as we can tell, exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover some of the ones that we're responsible for. JOE BATTIPAGLIA: Mr. Glynn, the brownouts continue in California. What's the status of supply of electricity into the state, putting aside for a moment how you pay for it? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak. Every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 and probably 2002 as well, simply because there's not enough power to go around. BATTIPAGLIA: Does that spread from California to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity market and the Pacific Northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many, many years shipping power back and forth to one another. That has been interrupted because of the supply shortage in California, which means that California is trying to be a net importer all the time. And it seems like the Pacific Northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to California that it's had in the past. HAINES: Does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? GLYNN: I don't think it ends there at all, Mark. And I certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use its capital on, like education and infrastructure. And I do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. It's got to be resolved by building new supply. There's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple of years before that new construction is fully completed. HAINES: All right, sir. Thank you very much for the update. We appreciate it. Robber Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO.

BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everything I know about the spoken word I learned right here at Yale. ??(LAUGHTER) ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ANNOUNCER: Now Judy Woodruff takes you INSIDE POLITICS. ??JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you for joining us. ?We begin with the Bush administration responding to pressure to get more involved in promoting Middle East peace. ??As an escalating cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians continued today, Secretary of State Colin Powell appointed a diplomat to help the two sides end the fighting and resume talks. ?And he urged the parties to use the report of a commission appointed by former President Clinton as a springboard to peace. ??Let's get more now from CNN national security correspondent David Ensor -- David. DAVID ENSOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Judy, Ambassador William Burns, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, who is Mr. Powell's pick to be the next assistant secretary for the Middle East, has been asked to work with other recommendations for Mr. Powell and for President Bush on how the U.S. can best proceed from here, trying to use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report to try to get the violence to de- escalate, to try to get the two sides talking instead of shooting at each other. ??Here is how Mr. Powell put it today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??POWELL: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud-and- clear way, and take actions that are available to them on both sides to let's have a cessation of hostilities, then we can begin the confidence-building measures and move toward negotiations. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ENSOR: Now this report makes very specific recommendations and urges very specific actions by both sides: in both cases, quite difficult actions. ?First, it calls for the Palestinians and the Israelis to declare an immediate, unconditional cessation of violence. That's the first step, and that's the step that Secretary Powell repeatedly emphasized today must come first and must come right away or else nothing else will work. ??But the report goes on to make specific recommendations. ?For example, it urges that Israel put -- freeze all settlement development, all development of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. ?It recommends that Israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the Palestinian Authority. ?It recommends a whole range of action, many of them to be taken by Israel, which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it needs to be, would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. ??The -- the secretary, Secretary Powell, said that this is not the time, however, for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?He wants first to have Ambassador Burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next week, two weeks or three, and then he and the president will try to figure out where the U.S. can go from here. ??But clearly, this is -- clearly, this is a first step by an administration that until now has tried to keep its -- keep its powder a bit dry in the Middle East. ?They are now engaging somewhat, because they're so concerned about the situation out there, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: David, the report, the Mitchell report, suggesting that the Israelis more responsible here, or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the Palestinians? ENSOR: The report is very even-handed. ?It doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?It, for example, does not blame Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for the following Intifada, Intifada II it's been called. ?But it says that there needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions, and if you look at the list of what it's asking for, there are more steps that the Israelis would have to take than the Palestinians. ??WOODRUFF: And David, why is it that the administration is saying at this point that it is not prepared to get back in -- in a -- in a day-to-day way, in an energetically involved way the way the Clinton administration was? ??ENSOR: Well, I think the administration, this administration, feels that the Clinton people got -- got to the point where they were micromanaging the thing a little bit. ?It was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?They feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??However, the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly, and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?And that's why Ambassador Burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: All right. ?David Ensor reporting for us from the State Department. ??For more on the Middle East conflict, stay with us for a special half-hour report. ?That's beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. ??Now, we turn to questions about the Bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?Tonight, Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to host some 400 big GOP donors at his official residence in Washington. ?A spokeswoman for the Democrats says that that event smacks of, in her words, hypocrisy. ??The Democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable to Clinton-era events, such as White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers for big donors, which drew heavy criticism from Republicans. ?Among them: presidential candidate George W. Bush. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??BUSH: I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here,"" from the Oval Office desk to the buck stops here on the Lincoln Bedroom. ?And that's not good for the country, it's not right. ?We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There's a huge trust. ?I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, ""I don't want you to let me down again."" ??And we can do better than the past administration has done. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Despite that sort of criticism then, the Republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at Vice President Cheney's home tonight. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MAJORITY LEADER: I'm sure it's being done in an inappropriate way, or Dick Cheney wouldn't -- wouldn't be doing it. ?So if there's any question, I'd suggest you address it to them. ?Unfortunately, I think that most of us will not be able to be there. ?We're going to be here voting, giving tax relief. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Virtually all of those GOP contributors, who will mingle with Vice President Cheney at his home tonight, have given at least $100,000 to the Republican National Committee. ?They will also attend a major RNC fund-raiser tomorrow night that features President Bush as the main speaker and is expected to net some $15 million in soft money. ??Now let's bring in our White House correspondent, Major Garrett. ??Major, tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??MAJOR GARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's the first official Republican National Committee event to honor the president and the first lady, as you said. The targeted haul is $15 million. Republican National Committee officials tell CNN that it's about 70 percent of that 15 million will be soft money. ?About 30 percent will be hard dollars -- that is dollars that are regulated under the existing campaign finance scheme -- and that it is a big event, one that the Republican Party has held for years and years in Washington. ??As for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told me this is a way of saying ""Thank you,"" in his words, ""to those Republicans who,"" as Ari Fleischer said, ""did so much to help win the selection."" ??And he draws a distinction with the Clinton-era coffees and sleepovers, describing them as, quote, ""organized schemes to bring people through the gates of the White House to get money or to persuade others to do so."" ??Mark Minor, who is the communications director for the Republican National Committee, also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. No checks will pass between hands there. There is no quid pro quo, and that some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact RNC donors -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: So, Major, again, clarify the distinction between money events that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??GARRETT: Well, it's a distinction this White House wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?In the words of Ari Fleischer, thanking someone, whether it's on government property or not on government property, is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?The distinction he is drawing is that during the Clinton era people were brought to the White House, to these coffees, and as was disclosed in the Thompson report that was conducted by the Senate investigating that, there was some evidence of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in, money was described to bringing in for a coffee. ?A certain dollar amount was attached to donations to the Democratic National Committee, a larger amount if they, in fact, slept here at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom. ?That is the key distinction, the Republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to come to the vice president's residence. ??They also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to Washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney in the vice president's home. ??WOODRUFF: And Major, just to clarify, the 400 people invited tonight to the vice president's, how many are they saying did not give money? ??GARRETT: They're not disclosing any numbers. ?They're only saying that some have given. ?They clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?Some are lobbyists. Some represent large corporations. ?But others, they say, are just Republican National Committee officials. And others of an undisclosed nature -- not fund-raisers, not Republican Party officials -- who will be there tonight. Don't have any numbers for you on that, though. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Major Garrett reporting at the White House. Thank you very much. ??Vice President Cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics, not to mention his role in creating the Bush energy plan. Look that this: ??Our new poll shows Cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?While Mr. Bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the past couple of weeks, he has lost ground since late April. ?Cheney's approval rating has dipped as well. ??For more on Mr. Bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies, we are joined now by our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ??Tell us, Bill, which of Mr. Bush's policies is the most popular? ??WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you might guess energy, given the high ratings for Dick Cheney that you just reported -- but you would be wrong. ??Because, what Americans like best is the tax cut. ?Two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?That's up from 60 percent earlier this month. Well, why not? ?What's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??Actually, most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?They like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?And that is why so many Democrats find it very difficult to oppose. ??WOODRUFF: What about the energy plan? ??SCHNEIDER: Not such a success. ?Not like the tax cut. ?Americans are actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?Why? ?It's not because the public blames the Bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?Most people blame the oil companies. ??In fact, more people blame Congress and the Clinton administration and environmental laws and American consumers than blame the Bush administration. But most Americans still give President Bush low marks on energy. ?The core criticism of his energy plan is: it doesn't do enough. ?55 percent of Americans say President Bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. ??What doesn't the plan do? ?It doesn't do much right now. ?Only 8 percent of Americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. Most people think oh, it will help, but only after several years. ?It's a long-run solution. ?Americans want help now. ?Right now. ?With electricity in California. ?And with gas prices all over the country. ?Long-term solutions are important, but politics is a short-term business. ?If the problem is now, people want results now. ??And they don't see what the Bush energy plan is going to do about $2-a-gallon gasoline now. ??WOODRUFF: Why do people think the energy plan fails to do that? ??SCHNEIDER: Because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?Oilmen like $2-a-gallon gasoline. ?Maybe even 3. ??By nearly two to one, the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the Bush administration's policies. ?In fact, Americans are split when you ask them whether the Bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?That sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?But any administration that's run by Texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Bill Schneider, thank you very much. You're not suspect. ??SCHNEIDER: I am certainly not. ??WOODRUFF: At least as far as we know. ??Do Californians blame President Bush for their energy crisis? We've heard a little bit from Bill on that. ?That answer and more on the issue later this hour. ?Plus: ??Just what kind of tax cut is the Senate considering? ?Jonathan Karl crunches the numbers. ?Also: ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?You don't set the agenda every day, and that is real power in the House. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The trials and tribulations of the minority leader, as he considers the present and the future. ?And later: ??Rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?A political ""Profile In Courage."" All ahead on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: President Bush today donned the traditional commencement robes, and gave the graduating class at Yale University a few bits of advice. ?The president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?As CNN's Kelly Wallace reports, today's speech was a departure from how the President's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??KELLY WALLACE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A homecoming of sorts, George W. Bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since graduating in 1968, returns to address those at the top and the bottom of Yale's graduating class. ??BUSH: And to the C students... ??(LAUGHTER) ??I say, you too, can be president of the United States. ??(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ??WALLACE: The president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as the undergraduate, when, as a history major, he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??The visit was not without controversy, with some students protesting and some professors boycotting, charging that Mr. Bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??PETER BROOKS, YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: It doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we think that Yale stands for. ??WALLACE: The president has kept his distance from this Ivy League institution for most of his political life, painting it as a symbol of elitism, even during his days at Yale. TERRY JOHNSON, BUSH'S YALE ROOMMATE: What George -- does not respond well to are people who are snobs, whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush rarely mentions what he did on this day, that he was born in New Haven when his dad, the former president, was an undergraduate at Yale. ??BUSH: My life began just a few blocks from here, but I was raised in West Texas. ?From there, Yale always seemed a world away. ??WALLACE: The president, for years, had been miffed with Yale for not awarding an honorary degree to his dad until 1991, the third year of his presidency. ?But it appears now, all is forgiven. ??BUSH: In my time they spoke of the Yale man, I was really never sure of what that was. ?But I do think that I am a better man because of Yale. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush, the son and grandson of Yalies and now father of a current student, seems very proud that Yale is a part of his past. ??Kelly Wallace, CNN, New Haven, Connecticut. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: And looking now ahead to 2004: the Reverend Al Sharpton says that he will explore seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ?The civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in Florida in the last presidential race. ??If he runs, Sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives, and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?Sharpton ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1994 and for mayor of New York City in 1997. ??Reverend Sharpton and former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer will discuss President Bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on ""CROSSFIRE."" That's at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. ??Another note from New York: a state supreme court justice today barred Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion. ?The judge ruled in favor of Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, who had requested a restraining order barring Judith Nathan from the residence. ?The ruling says that Nathan may not enter the residence as long as the Giuliani children continue to live there. ?The judge also denied Giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??And we'll have the latest on President Bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: This evening, the Senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?Republican leaders hope to give President Bush the tax cut for approval before Memorial Day. ?But as Jonathan Karl reports, taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??JONATHAN KARL, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Senate's $1.35 trillion tax cut would be the biggest in a generation, but don't spend your tax windfall yet. ?Most of the cuts will not take effect for several years to come. ??Relief from the so-called major penalty will not start until the year 2005. The estate tax won't be repealed until 2011. ?That means even if President Bush is re-elected, it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his second term. ?The IRA contribution limit would be raised from $2,000 to $5,000, but that also wouldn't happen until the year 2011. ??The tax cut calls for doubling of the child tax credit, but that takes 10 years too. ?The credit would rise from $500 to $600 this year, slowly increasing in $100 increments over the next 10 years until it finally reaches $1,000 in the year 2011. ?The cuts in income tax rates would be phased in even more slowly. ??SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA), FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You are right, some of them do not -- are phased in over a period of time. But there is real relief in this tax bill for every taxpayer starting January 1, 2001. ?They don't have to wait until next year. ??KARL: That immediate tax relief amounts to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples filing jointly, but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is still to be worked out. ?The option favored by the president is a simple rebate check sent directly to taxpayers, an idea opposed by many Senate Republicans who call it impractical. ??But the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut, which Democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. ??SEN. KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: This plan is fully back- loaded. ?That means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?This decade it cost $1.35 trillion. ?In the next decade, it will cost from 3.5 to $4 trillion. ??KARL: But there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?The tax cut includes a sunset provision, that means all the tax cuts in the bill would expire in the year 2012. ?For the tax cuts to remain in place, Congress would have to pass them again. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??KARL: Now, the Senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today, paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the Senate tonight. ?But it will not end there. ?This still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in House, the House passing almost exactly the president's tax cut, including much deeper cuts in income tax rates preferred by Republicans. ??The Senate and the House will have to work out their differences. They're expected to do so this week, setting the stage to send this final tax cut down Pennsylvania Avenue and onto the president's desk by Memorial Day -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: Jon, when you talk about the plan providing 300 or $300 a year per individual, divided by 12, that's $20-some a month. Is this the kind of money the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people with higher gasoline prices? ??KARL: This was exactly what he had it mind. ?This was exactly what he was talking about, directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers, directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??This is an idea that his Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, strongly favors, the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?But one big problem with this, Judy, is that taxpayers over the course of time move, they change addresses, some of them die. The question is, how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?It's not an easy proposition. ??WOODRUFF: And Jon, one other subject, we know the president's nominee to be solicitor general of the United States has run into a real problem in the Senate committee. ?Where does that stand right now? ?The last we heard, the Senate Judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of Ted Olson. ??KARL: Well, the Senate leaders, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, are now actively involved in this, trying to come to some kind of an agreement, an agreement that will allow the Democrats to get access to some information they want about Olson, especially information that was compiled by independent council Robert Ray, looking to just what Olson's involvement was in that Arkansas Project by the ""American Spectator"" magazine, the investigation into Bill Clinton's personal life. ??They want information from the independent council to look at just how involved Olson was in that project, to see whether or not he was truthful in his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?There's some movement to try to get the Democrats on the committee more of the information, also maybe to release more of it to the public. ??If that's all done, it would set the stage for a vote on the Olson nomination before the full Senate, but probably not until after Memorial Day. ?The Senate goes on recess at the end of the week, they will be off all of next week, you probably won't see a vote on the Olson nomination until after they return. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Jon Karl at the Capitol, thanks. In the House of Representatives, Democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the Republican majority. ?Add to that, critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?And life in the House minority begins to look bleak. ?Our Kate Snow caught up with the House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to talk about the balance of power and his political future. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D-MO), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We need to say what are we for, and that's what... ??KATE SNOW, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dick Gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a Democrat these days, stuck in the minority without the backing of the White House. ??GEPHARDT: Well, you take what you -- what you are given. ?I mean, the people run this country. ?We don't. ?And so, you fight for what you believe in as hard as you can, and if you really believe in it, then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??SNOW: Gephardt says the Democrats are forced to play defense, responding to Republicans. ??GEPHARDT: I think we slowed down a little bit the amount of the tax bill -- not enough, in my view -- but we lowered it some so that the potential deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?I think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill, at least the substance of it, but we still haven't been able to convince him or the Republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??On energy, I think that we've got a very, very positive alternative that I hope people will listen to. ?People in California and Oregon and Washington need help now. ??SNOW: That was last week's theme. ?First at a gas station, the lawn of the Capitol the next day, and then in a underground war room. ??Gephardt is a master at staying on message, often spending hours talking to the press, his strategy: agree with Republicans when he thinks they're right and hammer at home when he disagrees. ??GEPHARDT: If we do not learn from history, we are forced to repeat it. ?This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. ??I try not to yell. ?I try to get ideas across as good a way as I can. ?But there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?You need to let people know that you really care about this. ?And you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?And I think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??SNOW: But is the strategy working? ??I have talked to some Democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. Some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?They don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?Do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? ??GEPHARDT: I don't. ?I think that -- I think the ranks and the Democratic Party are largely unified. ?They are marching together and working together in ways that I've never seen them before. ?I always tell them that it's me and we. And we have to be a team. ??I would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens, but largely, I think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in Washington. ??SNOW: How much of your days are spent thinking about 2002 in the next election? ??GEPHARDT: Well, I want to win the majority back. ?I think it's really important, not for the party and not for me, but for the country. ??SNOW: Is it more important to win back the majority than it is to win legislatively for the next couple of years? ??GEPHARDT: I think it is in the House for sure, because the minority is really out of power totally in the House. ?You have no ability to bring up amendments, you don't set the agenda every day. And that is real power in the House. ??SNOW: There is a lot of focus on 2004, a lot of talk about your ambitions, do you have plans to run for president? ??GEPHARDT: I really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you, then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?And my goal is to win back the majority in the Congress in 2002. ?I think, as usual in our system, we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president, but that is not what I'm doing and not what I should be doing. ??SNOW (voice-over): Gephardt insists he's not planning ahead, though he's scheduled to attend four events in New Hampshire in two weeks. ??GEPHARDT: The future will take of itself. ?I have no idea what will happen, and I'm not worried about it, and I don't spend time worrying about it. Because, again, I've got to do this in 2002. ?This is what we're trying to do. ??SNOW: So, are you committed to staying minority leader through 2002? ??GEPHARDT: Absolutely. ?I'm totally committed to winning this House back, and I think we are going to do it. ??SNOW: Speaker of the House, you said to me last fall that that had a nice ring to it? GEPHARDT: It works for me. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Kate Snow talking with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. ?They talked today. ?And later this week, Kate will sit down with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ?You can look for that report on Friday. ??On another term for the another high-profile Republican and two nationally known Democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??INSIDE POLITICS will be right back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??To no one's surprise, Charlton Heston was reelected today to an unprecedented fourth term as president of the National Rifle Association. ?The 77-year-old actor was chosen at the NRA's annual convention in Kansas City. ?The group changed its rules last year to allow Heston a third term, and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him, once again. ??Former Attorney General Janet Reno may be looking for a new line of work. Now back in her native Florida, Reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??JANET RENO, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I love Florida very much. I was born and raised there. ?I have lived there most of my life. ?And I want to make sure that I do everything I can, either as governor or otherwise, to serve the interest of the people of Florida. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Reno says she does not believe that her Parkinson's Disease would keep her from running, and she expects to make a decision before the end of the year. ??Governor Jeb Bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??House Minority Whip David Bonior may trade in his Congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?The 13-term Congressman from Michigan filed his paperwork today to become a candidate in Michigan's 2002 governor's race. ?His aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?With Michigan slated to lose one House district, Bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's Republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?Republican Governor John Engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??Californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?We'll check new poll numbers from the Golden State, and discuss power politics in the state when we return. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: At ground zero on the energy crunch: more than half of Californians say they disapprove of the way President Bush is handling that state's power woes, according to a new poll. ?But the survey shows more Californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies, former Governor Pete Wilson and current Governor Gray Davis than on President Bush and the federal government. ?The Democrats are trying hard to convince Californians that Republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?Here is a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that begins airing in Los Angeles today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??NARRATOR: California's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. Yet President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?His spokesman saying, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter"" and our representative, Stephen Horn, has joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?Call Congressman Horn and tell him we need action now. ??That is if you can find the phone. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The Democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot, part of a month-long radio and TV ad campaign targeting Republicans on energy. ?Let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that Public Policy Institute of California poll we just told you about, Mark Baldassare joins us now from San Francisco. ??Mark, first of all, this poll finds Californians pessimistic in general, did that surprise you? ??MARK BALDASSARE, CALIFORNIA POLLSTER: It did. ?For the past three years, we've been in an incredible time of optimism in California. ?Two-thirds of Californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?Most Californians felt that economic times would continue to be good, and most Californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. For the first time, we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state, about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??WOODRUFF: And why do you think that is? ??BALDASSARE: Well, eight in ten Californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most Californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of Californians say it's a big problem and moreover, a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?So there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty, people are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??WOODRUFF: So you're saying because of the electricity crisis, if you want to call it that in California, it's now driving people's views of everything: population, the economy, across-the-board. ??BALDASSARE: We -- for the past few years people have been focused on improving the schools, for instance. ?Now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?And we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. ??WOODRUFF: Explain for us, Mark, who people are blaming. ?We were -- Bill Schneider reported earlier on the program that Americans, overall, are having mixed views about to what extent President Bush is responsible. ?Here we're learning in California, they hold President Bush far less responsible than they do local leaders. ??BALDASSARE: Yeah, well, we are at time right now in California where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?They've certainly heard about them. They haven't experienced, for the most part, frequent rolling blackouts, but they hear that they're coming. And so when we talk about blame, people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?And for that, of course, they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?Now, as we go forward over the next few months, people are going to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in place, and that's why I think both the Democrats and Republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. ??WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, what is your reading on this? ?Are ads, like the ones we just saw the Democrats running out there, are those likely to have an effect on people's views? ??BALDASSARE: I don't think so. ?I think that what is will most going to have a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?And if people feel that these electricity hikes have really, you know, altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy, if they feel blackouts are really going to, you know, put them in an uncomfortable situation going through the summer, then my guess is they are going to give blame both to Bush and to Davis. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Mark Baldassare of the California Public Policy Institute. ?Thanks very much, good to see you again. ??BALDASSARE: Thank you. ?Same here. ??WOODRUFF: As California tries to ease its energy problems, there are concerns about the cost not only for consumers, but for the environment. ?CNN's Rusty Dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one California plant's effort to expand. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An aging giant known as the Mighty Moss. ?The 50-year-old Moss Landing Natural Gas plant along California's coast owned by Duke Energy. ?A face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state, providing 2.3 million homes with light, heat and air conditioning. ?But all that power takes water to cool the turbines, water that's home to otters, fish, herons and other wildlife. ??CAROLYN NIELSEN, PLANT OPPONENT: Every day, Duke will use 333 football-size fields -- pools of water that are 10 feet deep. ?That is just incomprehensible. ??DORNIN: Water from the wetlands run through the plant, returning to the ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?Been that way for 50 years. ?Now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??PATRICIA MATEJCEK, SIERRA CLUB: Everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams, diatoms, young fish, everything in it will be killed. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists say the Mighty Moss got a break on the approval process, as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. It took 14 months. Permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??KAITILIN GAFFNEY, CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION: It's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. ??DORNIN: But here's the twist as part of the permit process: local environmental groups signed off on the Mighty Moss renovation plan. ??GAFFNEY: So at the eleventh hour, we were able to work out this deal with Duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. ??DORNIN (on camera): Duke Energy will spend more than $8 million expanding the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. There will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??TOM WILLIAMS, DUKE ENERGY: This will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. This state is in an energy crisis. ?The new plant we're bringing on is cleaner, more efficient than virtually any plant in the country today. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists made a deal here, but many fear, in a power-hungry state, taking what they can get may be their only option. ??Rusty Dornin, CNN, Moss Landing, California. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: A very different kind of power politics, circa the 1970s, is being seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?Former President Ford is honored for granting a famous -- some would say infamous -- at pardon. ??That's next on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: It is something that many Americans that lived through the Watergate era might never dream they would see. ?An award named for a Democratic icon presented to the man who angered many Democrats by pardoning Richard Nixon. ??CNN's Bruce Morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG, JOHN KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: He placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?We are honored to present you, President Ford, with the John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award for 2001. ??(APPLAUSE) ??BRUCE MORTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gerald Ford, now 87, got the award because, as a new unelected president, he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the Watergate scandal. ??RICHARD M. NIXON, 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. ??MORTON: ""Our long national nightmare is over,"" the new man said of Watergate. But really, what would end it? ?Nixon could still face charges. ??GERALD FORD, 38TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My conscience tells me that only I, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book. ??MORTON: And so he granted: ??FORD: A full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. ??MORTON: Many Americans thought that was a mistake. ??SEN. TED KENNEDY (D), MASSACHUSETTS: I was one of those who spoke out against his actions then, but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?And now we see that President Ford was right. ??MORTON: Not everyone agrees. ?Ford's press secretary at the time, Gerald Ter Horst, resigned to protest the Nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??JERRY TER HORST, FORMER FORD PRESS SECRETARY: He was going to go off scot-free, whereas all of his minions -- the people who worked at the White House, from the chief of staff on down to Ehrlichman, Chuck Colson and others -- they were going to have to do prison time; they were not going to get pardons. MORTON: And it may have cost Ford the 1976 election. ?It was a close election. Many things could have swung it, but the pardon was surely one. ?Jimmy Carter, who beat Ford, thanked him Inauguration Day. ??JAMES EARL CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land. ??MORTON: Accepting the award, Ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by ""partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy."" ??FORD: I sense a longing for community, a desire on the part of Americans to be part of something bigger, finer than themselves. ??MORTON: Historians may still argue about the pardon. ?They agree he cared about his country and its politics, and did what he thought was right. ??Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Also cited for political courage today, Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia who was beaten, as he and others challenged segregation during the freedom rides through the South in 1961. ??Lewis was given a special Profile of Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. ??Former president Ford, Congressman Lewis and Caroline Kennedy will all be guests tonight on ""WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.""

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE service. The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now. We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU, and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues. We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together. Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar. This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance. We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the setttlement discussions progress. A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me). I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask. If timing is bad for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative. I will follow up with a phone call to you. Hope this helps.",important

They= =20 say the plan is full of dangerously optimistic assumptions, such as estimat= es=20 that 90% of the state's alternative energy producers will be generating=20 electricity this summer--only two-thirds are now--and that Californians wil= l=20 use 7% less electricity. ?????Although Republicans don't control either house, the emergency=20 legislation requires a two-thirds vote, which gives the GOP significant swa= y. ?????The plan from the Republican leadership would commit taxpayer money fo= r=20 the first time to an electricity problem that has only affected customers o= f=20 private utilities. Because the plan is sure to draw strong opposition from= =20 politicians in Los Angeles and other areas served by public power agencies,= =20 Republicans have included a complex, $1.5-billion proposal to provide refun= ds=20 to those served by municipal utilities. ?????By blocking the emergency legislation, Republicans may stop state=20 Treasurer Phil Angelides from securing a $4.13-billion loan to repay state= =20 coffers for electricity purchases--a failure that would reduce the money=20 available to Davis for his next budget and possibly delay his plan to resol= ve=20 the energy crisis. Angelides needs the bill to guarantee repayment for the= =20 loan. ?????If Angelides does not obtain legislative approval by Monday, he will= =20 miss a Tuesday deadline lenders had given him to close the loan. That would= =20 clearly leave Davis with less money for new education, police and=20 road-building programs as he begins planning his next budget this month. ?????Moreover, failure to pass the bill could delay a record bond issue tha= t=20 Davis promised would replenish the budget and shield it from further energy= =20 drains by summer. And it could harm sagging confidence on Wall Street that= =20 California can deliver on its plans to manage the energy crisis, Angelides= =20 said. ?????California's credit rating has already been downgraded by one credit= =20 agency, Standard & Poor's, largely because of concerns about the effect of= =20 electricity purchases on state finances. ?????Negotiations Are Continuing ?????""The Republicans appear to be digging in and playing a dangerous game = of=20 financial roulette with the state.

Negotiations= =20 among legislative leaders continue. ?????To avoid widespread blackouts, the state government entered the=20 electricity-buying business in January after the private utilities became t= oo=20 burdened with debt to continue purchasing power on the expensive wholesale= =20 market. ?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,= =20 the state budget is to be repaid for the power purchases through a massive= =20 municipal bond issue, expected to be the largest in American history. The= =20 bonds, in turn, are to be paid off by utility ratepayers through a slice of= =20 their monthly bills. ?????However, the plan was based on the premise that the state would quickl= y=20 bring down power costs by entering into long-term contracts with suppliers-= -a=20 scenario that has yet to materialize. ?????In fact, California's power costs have gone up since January. Lawmaker= s=20 initially estimated that $10 billion in bonds would allow the budget to be= =20 repaid and cover future power purchases. Davis is now proposing $12.5 billi= on=20 in bonds--and higher electric bills--to finance the state's costs until 200= 3. ?????Republicans are convinced that it will not be enough. They say the=20 Angelides bridge loan is not needed because the state has money in various= =20 funds that could cover power purchases well into the fall. ?????They also confess to political considerations. Republican legislators= =20 believe that by allowing Angelides to obtain his loan now, they will be=20 powerless to oppose further borrowing later. The loan Angelides set up with= =20 J.P. Morgan Chase and several other financial services companies is to be= =20 repaid with the bond issue. If the loan is not repaid by the end of the=20 summer, the interest rate will rise dramatically, a situation that would ma= ke=20 it hard for the minority Republicans to oppose more bonds. ?????The strong GOP views were shaped in part by Democratic state Controlle= r=20 Kathleen Connell, who met with Republican legislators earlier this week and= =20 shared a highly critical appraisal of Davis' plan. ?????Connell told the Republicans that the governor's strategy was based on= a=20 series of assumptions about electricity market conditions in California thi= s=20 summer that, in her view, are highly improbable. ?????""It is almost impossible for all these hypothetical situations=20 envisioned in their scenario to occur at once,"" Connell said. ?????But even if all the assumptions came to pass, she predicted that=20 California would still need to secure another source of financing by next= =20 spring to continue energy purchases. Davis administration officials have=20 rebutted her claim. ?????""I am deeply troubled by this incremental approach to this financing= =20 that is long-term in nature and is going to burden the state for many years= ,""=20 Connell said, in what appeared to be a reference to Davis' reputation as a= =20 plodder.=20 ?????Using Surplus to Pay for Electricity ?????Republicans, who have traditionally been opposed to financing public= =20 programs with large bond issues, contend that Davis needs to reevaluate his= =20 plan. By proposing to essentially forget the $5 billion the state has spent= =20 so far on power, they are advocating using up the state's projected budget= =20 surplus on electricity costs, even if it means cutting new government=20 programs. ?????""If Gov. Davis continues down this path, he could bankrupt the state,""= =20 said Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia).

PG&amp;E had asked the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to overrule PUC decisions that the utility was not entitled to the money, which the utility spent buying electricity on the increasingly expensive wholesale market. In dismissing the lawsuit Wednesday, Judge Ronald S.W. Lew said ``PG&amp;E's claims are not yet ripe for review,'' meaning the case wasn't ready for trial. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, declared the decision a win for California ratepayers. ``PG&amp;E was banking on winning this case and using it as one of their excuses for not negotiating with the governor. It appears at least for now they failed,'' Maviglio said. But because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds rather than merit, PG&amp;E said the door was left open for the utility to refile its action once the commission makes final its interim orders on PG&amp;E's requested rate increase. ``The court determined that our lawsuit was premature because the CPUC had not yet finalized its various decisions on PG&amp;E's request for recovery of its costs to purchase wholesale power,'' PG&amp;E said in a statement. ``Today's action allows us to continue to pursue the merits of the case on a timely basis.'' A similar federal case filed by Southern California Edison is on hold, said company spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow. Edison, the state's second-largest utility, would drop that case as part of a rescue plan negotiated by Davis, which also includes the state buying the utility's transmission lines for $2.7 billion. Since last June, the two utilities say they have lost more than $14 billion. California's 1996 deregulation law froze electricity prices for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. When prices rose to record levels over the past year, PG&amp;E was unable to recoup the higher costs from its customers' bills. The undercollection, along with a failed deal to sell its transmission lines to the state, drove PG&amp;E to file for federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 6, the company argued. On Wednesday, the parent company, PG&amp;E Corp., reported a first-quarter loss of $951 million, or $2.62 per share. The first-quarter loss follows a fourth-quarter loss of $4.1 billion that also stemmed from continuing costs in California's power crisis. Bankruptcy Update/ PG&E Files Motion to Require CAISO to Follow Federal Law SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation - Pacific Gas and Electric Company has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court asking the court to direct the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to comply with bankruptcy law, its Tariff, and a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruling, and stop billing the utility for wholesale power purchased. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's motion, which includes a request for a preliminary injunction, asks the court to enjoin the CAISO from requiring the utility to pay costs the CAISO has incurred and continues to incur to purchase wholesale power on its behalf, unless the utility can fully recover these costs. Bankruptcy law imposes an automatic stay to prevent parties from making certain claims or taking certain actions that would interfere with the estate or property of the estate of a Chapter 11 debtor. By purchasing power at costs higher than existing retail prices, and then sending the bill to the utility, the CAISO is violating the automatic stay provision and could be reducing the value of the company's assets by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars per month, depending on the average retail rate, the wholesale price, and the amount of power purchased by the CAISO. Recently, the CAISO sent Pacific Gas and Electric Company a bill for January and February spot market purchases that totaled nearly $1 billion. The action alleges that requiring the utility to pay more than it can collect in its existing generation-related rates would be improper under federal Bankruptcy Code because it is not in the best interest of the estate, would be an unauthorized post-petition use of Pacific Gas and Electric Company's property, and would force the utility to undertake credit on onerous terms. In addition, on April 6, 2001, FERC ordered the CAISO to comply with its February 14 order, in which FERC ordered that the CAISO could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities. Both Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company are no longer creditworthy companies. By continuing to purchase power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the CAISO is in violation of its own Tariff, FERC orders, and federal law.

The horrible year for California began last May when electricity prices suddenly began to soar, triggering a debate about the cause of the mysterious price increase that is likely to continue for years. It started when a three-day heat wave, from May 21 to May 24, set records in some areas of the state and drove up the demand for electricity as Californians sought relief with air conditioning. More record heat June 14 in the San Francisco Bay Area strained the overloaded system of Pacific Gas & Electric and resulted in rolling blackouts, the planned temporary power outages that some fear may be routine this summer. The average price of electricity on the now-defunct Power Exchange soared to $120 per megawatt hour in June, five times higher than the same month the previous year, and remained roughly at that level until skyrocketing to $377 in December. San Diego sounded the statewide alarm last summer as San Diego Gas & Electric, the first utility to be deregulated, passed along much of the higher cost of electricity to its customers, until legislation rolled back and capped the utility's rates in September. The executive director of a San Diego consumers group, the Utility Consumers' Action Network, thinks the generators and the marketers of power, using sophisticated computer methods, learned something as the heat wave drove up the demand for power. ""It was the first time the generators had an opportunity to see how high the price could go,"" said UCAN'S Michael Shames. ""It was their primer. It was Gouge 101."" State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who chaired a two-house committee that completed the deregulation plan in 1996, had seen routine monitoring data suggesting that the power market was being manipulated to drive up prices. Peace took the unusual step last June of personally urging the adoption of a much lower price cap by the board of the agency that makes last-minute power purchases to maintain the grid, the Independent System Operator. But the motion failed by a single vote. The consumer representative who cast the decisive vote against the lower cap resigned afterward with a blast at Peace, complaining of heavy-handed pressure. Peace is unapologetic. He believes that stronger action by the ISO last June would have sent a signal that might have discouraged market manipulation. ""It's just like the Federal Reserve mis-timing an interest-rate move,"" Peace said. The former ISO chairman, who represents generators, cited an ISO report attributing the price increase last May to the heat wave, power plant outages, less hydroelectric power and higher prices for the natural gas used by power plants. ""I think all of those things showing up at the same time resulted in significantly higher prices,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers. Why power prices remained at high levels and even soared last winter, instead of dropping as usual, is more difficult to explain. The ISO contended last month that generators overcharged by more than $6 billion from last May through February. But federal regulators, who have their critics, have found only $125 million in overcharges, making it an ""annus marvelous"" for generators. Ed Mendel is Capitol bureau chief for the Union-Tribune.

Gov. Cruz Bustamente, who is promoting a bill that would level criminal penalties for exploiting energy markets. ?""If what they are doing isn't illegal, it ought to be."" ???Bustamente was one of a crowd of state leaders who went before microphones. ???On the floor of the Assembly, Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, rallied his Democratic colleagues behind a bill to create a state power authority with equally blistering attacks on private power suppliers. ???But after Thursday's hearing before a Senate committee formed to investigate alleged price-fixing in the energy market, committee chairman Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, told a reporter: ""I've never seen this much smoke when there wasn't a fire."" ???Power generators insist they are operating fairly and say there is no evidence of them acting outside the law. ???Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, dismissed the harsh rhetoric as unproductive. ""Putting people in prison isn't going to encourage more generation,"" Smutny-Jones said, warning that the political posturing would make energy generators think twice about investing in California. ???Also on Thursday, experts said federally ordered caps on wholesale electricity prices won't necessarily mean California will escape rolling blackouts this summer.

Updated: Monday, April 30, 2001 12:40 AM?ET ????? ? Such a surcharge, at least in the short run, would fall hardest on the state of California, which since January has spent more than $5 billion buying power because the utilities have been unable to meet their obligations. For now, the idea is nothing more than a proposal that occupies one paragraph buried in a 39-page order issued Thursday concerning changes to California's flawed deregulated electricity market. The commission is seeking public comment on the surcharge proposal for 30 days. After that, it will decide whether to implement it. The fee was proposed by Commission Chairman Curt Hebert, a Mississippi Republican, as a way ""to stabilize the market,"" he said Friday, ""since part of the problem in California has to do with nonpayment of bills by the utilities."" But the provision also has the potential to funnel billions of dollars to energy suppliers at a time when those payments are the subject of intense negotiation. One of the utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG, news, msgs), filed for protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy law on April 6, hoping to settle its claims with power suppliers for something less than face value. Representatives of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) Southern California Edison declined to comment on the FERC proposal Friday. The surcharge idea faces stiff opposition from some state officials, one of whom said it amounts to an ""unwarranted intrusion"" into state jurisdiction. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said imposition of a surcharge would put pressure on wholesale-power costs that already are too high. Bulk power cost $7 billion in California in 1999 and topped $27 billion last year as prices careened out of control. Ms. Lynch said she opposes the surcharge provision and the entire order given Thursday, but that it will be up to the full commission to decide how -- or whether -- to file a challenge at FERC. A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said ""the governor would be strongly opposed to any attempt to siphon money away from the state"" and expects to lodge an objection. Los Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 30, 2001, Monday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 792 words HEADLINE: CAPITOL JOURNAL; CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; How Sales Tax Is Falling Through a Loophole BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Dot-coms are in distress and laying off. Silicon Valley is a home buyer's bazaar. The Nasdaq is nauseous. So is this any time to be siccing the tax collector on Internet retailers? ??You bet. Coddling these techie traders with tax favors doesn't seem to be helping them much anyway. So why not treat e-tailers like everyone else, like brick-and-mortar merchants? Treat everybody evenhandedly. ??That's the view of Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), assertive chair of the Assembly Appropriations Committee. For the second straight year, Migden is pushing a bill she says will close a loophole that benefits some Internet retailers. She insists it's about fairly enforcing existing law, not about a new Web tax, as critics claim. ??Present law requires Internet e-tailers to collect the sales tax if they have a physical presence in California, such as a traditional brick-and-mortar store. But some big outfits have created separate out-of-state subsidiaries to handle their Internet orders. Same goods, same ads--with a large tax loophole because the subsidiary ostensibly does not have a physical presence in California. ??Never mind that an unsatisfied customer of bookseller Barnes & Noble dot-com, for example, can return the Internet purchase to the local Barnes & Noble store. ??Many e-tailers with dual ""bricks-and-clicks"" operations do collect the sales tax from Internet customers. Migden cites Macy's, Wal-Mart, REI, Hewlett-Packard and Eddie Bauer. Others refuse, she says: Barnes & Noble, Borders Books, KB Toys, Gateway Computers, Radio Shack. ??Her bill simply ""clarifies"" that the sales tax applies when the e-tailer is affiliated with a California business, sells identical products, and they market jointly. ??""Right now,"" Migden contends, ""certain big businesses blatantly violate the tax law and put hard-working, honest small business people at a disadvantage."" ??* ??Gov. Gray Davis is miffed at Migden, she hears. He vetoed her bill last year, declaring ""it would send the wrong signal about California's international role as the incubator of the dot-com community."" Internet marketing ""must be given time to mature,"" he maintained. ??Now Migden's at it again. ""The governor's exercised. He thinks I'm jamming him,"" she says. ""But I'm moving the bill. He can veto it if he wants. I'm putting it on his desk."" ??It already has cleared the Assembly tax committee and will shoot out of her panel Wednesday, headed for the Assembly floor. Last year, Democrats backed the bill. Republicans opposed it, siding with the Democratic governor. ??Davis fears some future opponent will claim he signed a bill to tax the Internet. Migden is frustrated by that Internet tax tag, calling it ""a lazy misinterpretation."" ??""I'm not picking on e-commerce,"" she protests. ""I'm picking on the multinationals who are arrogantly evading the law in complicity with the state Board of Equalization."" ??That would be, in particular, Republican board member Dean Andal of Stockton. ""It's the usual liberal nut case bill,"" Andal says. ""Just a bill chasing no problem."" ??* ??The BOE administers the sales tax. And Andal does agree that if an Internet purchase can be returned to a store, the e-tailer legally must collect the tax. ""We've been looking into that,"" he says. ??The board shouldn't have to look far. Barnes & Noble tells e-customers right on its Web site that ""you can return purchases to ANY Barnes & Noble store for in-store credit."" ??But other than that, Andal contends, a company has a constitutional right to create an out-of-state subsidiary to avoid taxes. ??And, he notes, we're talking about relative pennies: $ 17 million annually, the BOE estimates, compared to $ 39 billion in total California sales tax collections. That lost revenue would cover only about seven hours worth of electricity the state now is buying for utilities. ??But e-tailing is bound to grow. Tax avoidance could become significant, benefiting dot-coms while discriminating against small retailers and the poor who cannot afford Internet access. ??Migden will be in a strong position to change sales tax policy if she wins her race next year for the five-member BOE. She's the early front-runner. ??Her concern--her reverence--is for the local booksellers, the mom-and-pop merchants, the neighbor shopkeepers who can be smothered by the big tax evaders. ""The little guy with the books stacked in the back,"" she says, ""sweeping the sidewalk, putting on extra locks, obeying the law and collecting taxes--trying to make a go."" ??Davis wants to be seen as a futuristic, New Age pol, worthy of campaign donations from wealthy Web masters. But he can manage that without tromping on his Democratic roots as protector of the little guy.

BYLINE: TIM REITERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??It reads like a phone book: Able Auto Body, Able Building Maintenance, Able Fence Co., Able Printing, Able Termite & Pest Control. . . . ??These companies are among about 50,000 entries on Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s roster of creditors recently filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. ??Another company, A&J Electrical Cable Corp. of Hayward, has supplied PG&E with utility cables since 1980. But now the unpaid bills are hitting the $ 100,000 mark--and that is a big deal to a relatively small business. ??""Who would ever think that PG&E would be in bankruptcy?"" said owner Magdalene Reilly. ""This is something affecting people. I've got a lot of paychecks on Friday. ??""We have orders for the rest of the year from PG&E ,"" she added. ""It is a question: Do you decide to ship? . . . We probably will. They are a good customer."" ??When PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors April 6, businesses from California to Canada were caught by surprise. The names of the 20 biggest creditors, some with billion-dollar claims, were filed with the court. The utility also submitted a list of potential creditors--more than 3,500 pages worth. ??The roster speaks to the remarkable economic clout and reach of a company that prospered for almost a century before plunging into the third-biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. It provides a glimpse into the relationships between a giant utility--the state's largest--and businesses of all sorts and sizes. And it underscores the high stakes as a bankruptcy judge reorders PG&E's financial affairs and decides in the coming months, if not years, who should be paid and how much. ??The case, said U.S. bankruptcy trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley, ""has a ripple effect. . . . Creditors are affected, and they can't pay their bills either."" ??There are small companies and conglomerates that sold power to PG&E. ??There are financial institutions from Wall Street to San Francisco's Montgomery Street that lent money or provided services. ??There are government agencies at all levels, even the California Public Utilities Commission. ??There are some retired PG&E employees and officers, including at least one of the company's former chief executive officers. ??But there also are vendors that have provided goods and services to PG&E for years: tree trimming around power lines, bodywork for the utility's truck fleet, fencing for its vast land holdings, calibration of meters, fans to cool electrical transformers, printing of brochures, signs for office doors, flight suits for aviators who patrol power lines, limousine service for traveling executives. ??No dollar amounts are attached to names on the master list. But records and interviews with dozens of creditors show that the sums owed range from hundreds of millions of dollars to very little--or nothing at all. Many of the smaller creditors were unaware they were on the roster until contacted by The Times. ??PG&E used to buy pump filters from California Pump & Supply in Sacramento. ??""We just closed out their account because they owed us $ 29,"" said office manager Lisa Giordano. ""It's a hassle to get anyone over there. I just wrote it off."" ??The utility bought $ 38 worth of plants from Forest Nursery in Los Osos, west of San Luis Obispo. ""It's nothing to go to court about, especially since they paid it,"" said bookkeeper Lori Parsons. ??A wine wholesaler, an ice cream company and a coastal hotel are listed. So is Sing A Long Productions in Burlingame, which supples disc jockeys and karaoke. ??""I am sure we have done business with PG&E and other companies that have parties from time to time,"" said owner Nick Foster. ""Maybe somebody forgot that we did not get paid."" ??PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the list includes everyone to whom the utility wrote a check in the last two years, such as homeowners who received energy conservation rebates and retirees who received checks related to benefits. ??""It was an attempt to notify anybody who possibly could have a claim against the company and to cast the widest net possible,"" he said. ??Several PG&E retirees, such as Robert W. Oliver of Berkeley, were baffled by their inclusion on the list. ""I draw a little pension,"" said Oliver, who was a personnel executive and left the company in 1980. ""It's a vested pension."" ??Another retiree on the list is former Chief Executive Richard A. Clarke. ??He and about 10 other former high-ranking PG&E executives or their survivors have retained an attorney to help ensure that their retirement benefits are protected during the bankruptcy case. ??""We don't want someone to get the idea that this is a bunch of well-heeled executives trying to get a piece of the action,"" said the attorney, John T. Hansen. ""Some in our group are widows of former executives who depend on the pensions they receive as survivors."" ??Hansen said some retired executives have deferred-compensation packages that might be considered a general unsecured bankruptcy claim. ??One concern, he said, is that PG&E Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. wrote recently in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed article that health care plans and other benefits ""for employees and most retirees"" will continue. ??""We would want to know what 'most' is,"" Hansen said. ""We want to sort it out."" ??Low of PG&E said fewer than 100 retired employees, most former officers, ""have a portion of their pension that is unsecured."" That means their claims will be handled in Bankruptcy Court with those of other unsecured creditors whose debts are not backed by utility assets. ??The spokesman emphasized that ex-employees could be on the list because they received a check from the company for something. ??Companies and individuals on the list, PG&E said, will be contacted and given an opportunity to state their claims, which the utility will file with the court May 11. ??Meanwhile, the effects of the bankruptcy filing continue to ripple beyond the utility. ??PG&E's action hit AA Safe & Lock Co. in Santa Cruz particularly hard. The firm replaces keys and locks for PG&E offices and trucks. ??""We are a small business, and it is a big account,"" said owner Paul Bing, who declined to say what the utility owes. ""We haven't been doing as much for them since the whole crisis started."" ??A Hayward firm that conducts environmental testing when PG&E remodels or razes buildings is out money too. Ken Byk, president of Forensic Analytical, would not provide a figure but said: ""I am obviously concerned. . . . They are a good customer, but any time you run into these problems, it's disappointing."" ??California Steam Inc. of Sacramento services PG&E pressure washers and water recyclers at its truck-cleaning facilities. ""I have just a couple of invoices out,"" said service manager Bruce Amlin. The debt, he said, is less than $ 500. ??A similar amount is owed to California Turbo Inc. in Ontario. Sales manager Cam Young said the utility has not paid for eight fans used to cool electrical transformers. ""We're a small business,"" Young said, adding with a laugh: ""We might have to eat peanut butter and jelly for four or five months."" ??Within days of the bankruptcy filing, PG&E sent about 12,000 creditors letters that began: ""Valued Goods and Services Provider: . . . Unfortunately, the bankruptcy code precludes payment for goods and services received prior to the date of filing. Payments on this pre-petition debt will be settled as part of the plan of reorganization."" The company assured vendors that they will be paid for any future purchases. ??Some are not only forgiving, they are outspokenly loyal to PG&E. ??The relationship between the utility and AG Signs of Stockton spans two decades. When Tony Guebara was starting his company, PG&E gave him business. ""They try to help the little guy,"" he said. ""Just about everybody in town is a vendor. They have people here who paint their trucks."" ??AG Signs now has five employees and supplies PG&E with door lettering for trucks, name plaques for office doors and signs and flags for construction sites. ??Guebara said the utility's debt does not worry him: ""PG&E has treated me real well. If I lose a couple of bucks because of this adversity, that is OK. . . . I don't think we've seen the last of PG&E."" ??Many businesses and individuals said they had no idea why the company believes it owes them money. ??Being included on the creditors list left the Vallejo Camp Fire Girls & Boys and other charitable organizations somewhat confused. Officials of one Berkeley church could only speculate that it was listed because PG&E stock was bequeathed to the congregation decades ago. ??Twylah Lemargie, manager of the Cancer Aid Thrift Shop in Grass Valley, said the utility is not even a customer. ""PG&E did come in and replaced lots of our ceiling lights with the long tubes,"" she said. ""But it was done free as an energy saver."" ??A number of vendors said PG&E's account is paid up. ??The utility rented temporary housing units for workers on a hydroelectric project about two years ago, but California RV Rentals in Rio Lindo is still named as a creditor. ""They don't owe me money,"" said Sandra Weaver, the manager. ""If they want to give me some, it's OK."" ??Many creditors are health clubs and health care providers: medical and dental offices, foot and joint specialists, pharmacies, chiropractors. ??When informed that the Castro Valley Chamber of Commerce was on the creditors list, the woman who answered the phone laughed uproariously. Then Executive Director Bonnie Dettmer came to the line. ??""I'm going to guess it's membership dues,"" she said. ""They are a member and they have been very supportive. I would bet they belong to every chamber of commerce."" ??One creditor is the state agency that PG&E says drove the company into insolvency by not allowing full recovery of its wholesale power costs. ??""They owe us $ 5.9 million . . . for environmental impact reports on PG&E projects,"" said Paul Clanon, director of the Public Utilities Commission's energy division. ""It's a serious amount of money but currently is not having an impact."" ??Top 10 Creditors ??The creditors owed the most money by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., according to the company's Chapter 11 filing: ???Creditor owed ???Bank of New York ????????????????????????$2.20 billion ???California Power Exchange ???????????????$1.96 billion ???Bankers Trust Co. ???????????????????????$1.30 billion ???California Independent System Operator ??$1.12 billion ???Bank of America* ?????????????????????????$938 million ???US Bank million ???Calpine Gilroy Cogeneration LP ????????????$58 million ???Calpine Greenleaf Inc. ????????????????????$49 million ???Crocket Cogen million ???Calpine King City Cogen LLC ???????????????$45 million ??* Heading a group of banks ??Source: U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern DIstrict of California GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: Top 10 Creditors, Los Angeles Times PHOTO: Magdalene Reilly, owner of A&J Electrical Cable Corp. of Hayward, says her company has supplied Pacific Gas & Electric with utility cables since 1980, and that their unpaid bills are now hitting the $100,000 mark. ?PHOTOGRAPHER: ROBERT DURELL / Los Angeles Times PHOTO: ""They try to help the little guy,"" says Tony Guebara, owner of AG Signs in Stockton, of PG&E.

DAVIS' PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR FACES DEMANDS FOR BILLIONS AS A RESERVE AND TO CUSHION ELECTRICITY RATE HIKES. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Jockeying over the state's next spending plan, a tradition that usually takes place in the summer, already is turning intense as the energy crisis casts a pall over what otherwise might have been relatively painless budget squabbles. ??A key state senator, worried about the slowing economy, is looking for places to pare as much as $ 4 billion from Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $ 104.7-billion budget. And Republicans are beginning to demand that the state spend billions in general tax money to cushion electricity rate hikes of up to 40% being imposed on consumers and businesses. ??Davis won't sign the budget for the 2001-02 fiscal year into law until late June at the earliest. But with California mired in the energy crisis and the economy slowing, the new budget is shaping up to be especially vexing. ??California's largest utility and a major private employer, Pacific Gas & Electric, is in bankruptcy. The state has spent $ 5.2 billion in general tax money to buy electricity, with no end in sight. Even before summer temperatures hit, Sacramento shelled out $ 90 million to buy electricity in a single day last week. ??And the Wall Street rating firm Standard & Poor's, unsure that the state will be reimbursed for the power purchases, lowered California's credit rating two notches for the first time since the recession of the 1990s. ??Brightening an otherwise cloudy situation, income tax payments are meeting or exceeding predictions. More than $ 8 billion in checks from April income tax returns have flooded into the Franchise Tax Board, said Department of Finance economist Ted Gibson. On one day last week, the state's haul was $ 3.6 billion, a record. ??""Receipts are very much on track, I'm relieved to tell you,"" Gibson said. ??But even as budget writers were exhaling, the payments merely offered proof that the economy was strong last year, back when then-President Bill Clinton was heralding the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history, and Californians' lexicon did not include the term ""rolling blackout."" ??State income and sales tax receipts softened in the first few months of 2001, an indication that people will be earning less this year--and paying less in taxes next year. ??Seeing trouble ahead, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) wants to boost the state's emergency reserve, which was $ 1.9 billion in January. To do that, Peace last week called on budget committee members to come up with a list of cuts totaling $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion. ??Without a larger reserve heading into 2002, Peace said, the slowing economy could force the state to make deep cuts or raise taxes next year, at a time when most legislators and Davis will be running for reelection. ??""The thing to be worried about is not the current year, but the trend line,"" Peace said. ??He adds a caveat for the spending plan that by law must be in place by July 1: There will be cuts if legislators fail to approve legislation that state Treasurer Phil Angelides says he needs to obtain short-term loans and market long-term bonds to finance electricity purchases. ??Davis and Angelides are preparing the largest bond sale--a way that government borrows money--in U.S. history, as much as $ 12.4 billion. The state would use the proceeds to ease the shock to utility customers of record high electricity prices this year. The bond debt would be paid off over a period of perhaps 15 years. ??Given the size and complexity of the bond issue, many legislators say Angelides may not be able to sell it for months. ??Davis, however, has an immediate need for money. The governor must release a revised state budget within weeks. So, he is pushing for legislators to approve legislation that would allow Angelides to obtain a short-term loan of as much as $ 6 billion. ??At least some of the proceeds of the long-term bonds would be used to pay off the short-term loan--sort of like using one credit card to pay the balance on a second piece of plastic. ??Republican legislators are balking at the idea. ??Back in December, before the state entered the power buying business, GOP legislators had called for $ 3.2 billion in tax cuts. With the energy crisis complicating the financial situation, some Republicans are contending that Davis should use as much as $ 5 billion from the budget surplus to soften the impact of electricity rate hikes. ??""That will be a de facto tax cut,"" said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. ""Our Democratic friends want to do the bridge financing so they can increase the size of government."" ??Republicans are in the minority. But they have a significant voice, because state law requires that both houses of the Legislature approve spending decisions by a two-thirds vote. ??The state Constitution says the budget must be in place by the July 1 start of the new fiscal year. Davis signed his first two budgets on time. Given this year's uncertainties, however, some legislators are thinking twice about making July vacation plans. ??The sudden turnaround may come as a shock to many legislators and lobbyists who seek slices of the state budget pie. ??In recent years, legislators have grown used to the multibillion-dollar windfalls of tax payments, which allowed them to deliver new swimming pools, school programs, museums, parks, social and health care spending, and tax cuts to their constituents. Indeed, the budget in Davis' first two years grew 37%, even as the Democratic governor and legislators cut taxes by $ 3.9 billion. ??In a Legislature populated by term-limited newcomers, only a handful of current legislators were in the Capitol in the early 1990s, when the worst recession to hit California since the Great Depression caused the state budget to actually shrink. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature reacted to a $ 14-billion budget gap by raising taxes by more than $ 5 billion and slashing spending. ??""It is not going to be the pie-in-the-sky budget some of us thought it would be last year and even as late as January,"" said Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo). ??Veterans of the annual summer rite say there is no template for the coming budget fights. Jean Ross of the California Budget Project, a private budget watchdog and advocacy group, said Davis and legislators not only must pay attention to the economy. ??They also must take into account many unknowns: Will the judge overseeing PG&E's bankruptcy proceeding seek to raise rates further? Will federal energy regulators be able to effectively limit wholesale electricity costs? What will the economic impact be of summer blackouts? ??""It's a lot more complex and unpredictable than other years,"" Ross said. ??Legislators say they are lowering their sights. But letters from state senators requesting money for their favored projects fill five large red binders. ""You wouldn't know there is a money shortage based on requests in appropriations,"" said Assembly Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), preparing for what she calls her ""hatchet role"" of blocking bills that require spending. ??For his part, Davis has not decided to significantly cut back on his proposals, ranging from a sales tax ""holiday"" timed for back-to-school shopping to plans to clean sewage from beaches. He won't reveal those decisions until he releases his revised spending plan. LOAD-DATE: April 30, 2001 of 103 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 30, 2001, Monday, Home Edition SECTION: Metro; Part B; Page 7; Op Ed Desk LENGTH: 839 words HEADLINE: COMMENTARY; WILL THE FERC SEE THE LIGHT ON THE LAW? BYLINE: FRANK A. WOLAK, Frank A. Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University, is, chairman of the Market Surveillance Committee of the California, Independent System Operator BODY: ??Out-of-state firms selling into the California wholesale electricity market at exorbitant prices have been blamed for the current electricity crisis. They are, claim many observers, exercising their market power to raise wholesale electricity prices. ??Although it is not illegal under California or U.S. antitrust law for a firm to exercise its market power, it is illegal to do so under the Federal Power Act. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, which regulates the California wholesale electricity market, is the entity charged with enforcing this law. Its refusal to take sufficient actions that would result in ""just and reasonable"" wholesale electricity rates is the fundamental cause of California's current energy crisis. It is highly unlikely that anything it has done in the last week has changed things at all. ??In 1935, Congress passed the Federal Power Act and required the Federal Power Commission (the predecessor to FERC) to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale electricity prices. Just and reasonable prices are those that recover production costs, including a ""fair"" rate of return on the capital invested by the firm. Moreover, if the FERC finds that wholesale electricity prices are unjust and unreasonable, the Federal Power Act gives it wide-ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices. The FERC can also order refunds for any payments by consumers in excess of just and reasonable prices. ??Almost 10 years ago, the FERC began to allow generators to receive market prices instead of prices set through a cost-of-service regulatory process. However, there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the Federal Power Act. Markets often set prices substantially in excess of the production costs for significant periods of time. This occurs because one or more firms operating in the market have what economists call market power--the ability of a firm to raise market prices and profit from it. ??However, if no firm possesses market power, the market price should be very close to a price that only recovers production costs. In such a circumstance, the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the Federal Power Act. ??Before it allows any market participant to receive a market price rather than a cost-based price set through a regulatory process, the FERC requires each participant to demonstrate that it does not have market power. In other words, each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the FERC demonstrating it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this behavior. ??Each of the out-of-state generators made these filings before they began selling into the California market, which started in April 1998. Each firm had its authority to receive market prices approved by the FERC for a three-year period that ends before this summer for several of the firms. It is virtually impossible to determine on a prospective basis whether a firm possesses market power. Moreover, the methodology used by the FERC to make this determination uses analytical techniques that have long been acknowledged by the economics profession as grossly inadequate. The events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that contrary to their filings stating otherwise, all of the out-of-state generators possess significant market power. ??A number of independent studies have shown that the market power exercised by these firms has resulted in unjust and unreasonable rates from May 2000, until now. Moreover, in its Dec. 15, 2000 report on the California electricity market, the FERC concluded that wholesale electricity prices during the summer and autumn of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power. ??Despite its own conclusion, the FERC thus far has refused to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in California. Instead, the FERC implemented market rule changes that have enhanced the ability of these firms to set excessive wholesale electricity prices. In addition, it has refused to order refunds for any overpayment during the summer and autumn of 2000 for the prices that it deemed unjust and unreasonable. ??Fortunately for California consumers, the California Public Utilities Commission and Gov. Gray Davis refused to be accomplices in the FERC's decision not to enforce the Federal Power Act. They refused to pass on to California consumers prices that the FERC itself had determined were unjust and unreasonable. ??Because these out-of-state firms must apply for renewal of their market-based pricing authority before this summer, the FERC has one more opportunity to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in California. It has before it several proposals that would enforce all provisions of the Federal Power Act. The health of the California and national economies would be severely undermined if the FERC continues to ignore its legal obligations.

OPPEL Jr. and LAURA M. HOLSON BODY: ??Pacific Gas and Electric, the giant California utility, may have just made one of the largest bankruptcy filings in history, but it has been a banner year for the rest of its parent company, the PG& E Corporation. ??In Bethesda, Md., far from the energy crisis in California, another PG& E subsidiary, National Energy Group, earned $162 million last year and ranked as the nation's third-largest power trader. Compensation for the unit's executives soared. Many investors now believe that the subsidiary, just a decade in the making, is by itself worth more than its 96-year-old utility sibling. ???How did National Energy get so big so fast? By using cash, partly generated by its sister utility, to buy unregulated power plants in the Northeast, expand trading-floor operations and sell power across the country. The exact numbers are in dispute, but much of Nationals Energy's profits last year came from California. ??Most other large utilities have done the same thing over the past decade, building national or even global power companies from roots in local monopolies. But nowhere is the success of these unregulated businesses more of an issue than in California, where PG& E's investments may be challenged in bankruptcy court. ??Still, such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states, and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity. ??And today, the offspring of the nation's utilities dominate that market, after industry leader Enron. ?Eight of the nation's 10 largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities, controlling about 42 percent of power trading. ??It is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in California have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging, and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first, halting steps toward embracing last week. ??The profitability of the utilities' unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year. ??For example, Reliant Energy reported that operating income at its unregulated wholesale energy business soared to $216 million in the first quarter, or 16 percent more than at its regulated utility, which serves Houston. This week, Reliant expects to spin off its unregulated businesses through an initial public stock offering that would put a market value on the new company of as much as $8.8 billion -- more than the rest of Reliant. ??A number of other major utility companies have spinoffs or trading and generation units that now earn nearly as much as, or more than, their core utility operations. These include Duke Energy in Charlotte, N.C.; Sempra Energy of San Diego; the Southern Company in Atlanta; the Constellation Energy Group in Baltimore; and Utilicorp United in Kansas City, Mo. ??In some places, the growth of the unregulated businesses continues to raise questions of fairness -- particularly where utilities have been permitted to transfer plants to the new units at deep discounts to their market value. Critics say that ratepayers, whose bills paid for the plants' construction, should benefit more when the plants are sold. ??In Florida, a commission on energy deregulation formed by Gov. Jeb Bush has proposed permitting such transfers on the grounds that they are needed to create a new wholesale marketplace. Opponents, including the Florida Municipal Electric Association, which represents utilities owned by local governments, say the plan would produce a $9 billion windfall that should go to ratepayers. ??In California, some creditors of Pacific Gas and Electric have signaled that they will want the bankruptcy court in San Francisco to review parent PG& E's efforts to keep its unregulated businesses out of creditors' reach. ??And the California Public Utilities Commission is investigating whether PG& E and Edison International, whose Southern California Edison utility unit is also near insolvency, have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies. ??A recent audit ordered by the commission showed that Pacific Gas and Electric transferred $4.1 billion to PG& E from 1997 to 1999. Most of that went to dividends and stock repurchases, but $838 million was invested in other subsidiaries, primarily its National Energy Group unit. Southern California Edison transferred $4.8 billion to its parent company between 1996 and November 2000, a separate audit showed; Edison International invested $2.5 billion in its unregulated Mission Group subsidiaries during the same period. ??Executives of the companies say the transfers were proper. Audits have shown that ""we followed the rules and didn't do anything wrong,"" said PG& E's chief executive, Robert Glynn. ""We did not ask consumers in California to support any of the losses that occurred in those businesses when we started them up,"" he said. Now, forcing the unregulated units to support their ailing sister utility, he said, ""would be no different than calling up shareholders and saying, 'The California electric bills are pretty high; send some money in so we can give it back to them.' "" ??Loretta Lynch, the president of the utilities commission, took a different view. ""Should we look backward,"" she asked, ""and say, 'Hey, wait a minute -- that corporate structure profited by all of our power payments to them in the past, and they should participate in helping us through to get to a solution in the future?' "" ??The cornerstone deal of PG& E's unregulated energy business was struck four years ago, when it acquired the hydroelectric and fossil-fueled generation plants of New England Electric System for $1.6 billion. PG& E is now one of the largest generators in the Northeast, operating plants that can light up to five million average-sized homes. ??While California officials say Pacific Gas and Electric's woes have been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation by out-of-state generators, the Justice Department has been investigating possible market abuses involving PG& E and two other companies in New England. Mr. Glynn said that PG& E had done nothing wrong and that the company has responded to Justice Department requests for information. ??Overall, PG& E's National Energy Group has 30 power plants in 10 states, and others under development or construction that include one in Athens, N.Y., that is expected to begin supplying electricity to New York City in 2003. It also operates an energy trading operation in Bethesda and controls a natural gas pipeline into Northern California. ??To Wall Street, the utility companies' investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic, as investors demanded faster-growing profits. ??""The stock market was going like gangbusters, and the utilities' returns of 11 percent weren't cutting it,"" said Richard Cortright, a utility analyst at Standard and Poor's, the bond rating agency. ??Moreover, as deregulation loomed, industry executives saw no choice but to make new investments. ""It looked like the utility opportunity was going to start shrinking,"" Mr. Glynn said. ??Consumer groups question whether utilities would have invested more in improving basic service if they had not had the option of putting money elsewhere. ??Mike Florio, a lawyer with The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group in San Francisco, cited findings last year by state regulators that from 1987 to 1995, Pacific Gas & Electric spent nearly $550 million less on maintaining electric and gas facilities than had been factored into its rates. Separately, in 1999, the utility agreed to pay about $29 million to settle charges that consumers were endangered because it failed to trim trees near high-voltage power lines. ??""Several hundred million dollars didn't get spent for maintenance, and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit,"" Mr. Florio said. ??Mr. Glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance, coming within one-half of one percent of the amount built into rates over a 20-year period. ??In the big picture, he said, it was hard to see how PG& E had been a winner in deregulation, even before its utility's humiliating bankruptcy. ""If you look at what happened, the net of it was a loss,"" Mr. Glynn said, ""because the value leaked out on the regulated utility side faster than we were able to build it on the nonregulated side.""

Not that she's complaining. Hoge, 50, honestly loves her job and insists she wouldn't do anything else. ???""I've got a mutant gene,"" she said with a laugh as she relaxed, for just a moment, in a spartan office littered with messy piles of paperwork. ""I've always wanted to do this."" ???TURN has been keeping tabs on companies like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Pacific Bell for more than 25 years. Hoge and her crew lobby the Public Utilities Commission, counsel lawmakers, analyze reports and file the occasional lawsuit. They are, in short, professional gadflies who represent the public in a system that some say favors big business. ???""The biggest protector of the consumer, by far, has been TURN,"" said Bob Gnaizda, public policy director for the Greenlining Institute in San Francisco. ""(Hoge) has made TURN into the leading consumer utility advocate in the nation."" ???It's not glamorous work, nor is it particularly lucrative. Hoge, a lawyer by training, took a pay cut when she accepted the $75,000-a-year job in 1995. And, truth be told, most folks have no idea Hoge is in their corner. ???""There are other rewards,"" she said. ""You don't get the adoration of Joe Citizen standing up and yelling, 'Yay TURN!' But there's an excitement about being involved in the discussions where the big decisions are made."" ???The youngest of four children, Hoge bounced around the middle of the country as she grew up, following her career Army officer father from Kansas to Oklahoma to Texas. ???""All the places where you can shoot big guns,"" she joked. ???Hoge graduated from high school in Pullman, Wash. After a stint at the University of Southern California, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Washington State University and earned a law degree from the University of San Francisco. ???Hoge's entire career has been spent protecting the underdog.

""The partners would come around each month to check our billable hours. Mine were always zero."" ???Since taking the helm almost six years ago, Hoge has led TURN to some impressive consumer victories. They include persuading the Public Utilities Commission to create a $352 million fund to underwrite rural telephone service and bringing an end to ratepayer subsidies of PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in 2002. ???Hoge, a stickler for detail, has a reputation for giving exhaustive answers to even mundane questions. ???""Everybody agrees she knows what she's talking about,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""In many respects, TURN is the intellectual force in this debate.

""Maybe I overcompensate."" ???Few doubt Hoge's smarts, but she has plenty of critics among the utilities, lawmakers and lobbyists she has crossed swords with over the years. However, none of them will say anything publicly. ???""We have no comment on her,"" said Shawn Cooper, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent company of the foundering utility. ???It was the same story with Southern California Edison and many of the legislators who have criticized Hoge and TURN in recent years. ???Hoge isn't surprised her adversaries are keeping mum. ???""There's nothing for them to gain by saying anything negative about us because the public is on our side,"" she said. ???Still, TURN has drawn criticism from Carl Wood, generally considered the most ardent consumer advocate on the PUC. ???""Frankly, I would have expected myself to be on the same page with (TURN) more than I actually am,"" Wood said. ""I'm not sure they wholeheartedly believe in regulation, and I think it comes from a distrust of regulators. But maybe I'm taking it personally."" ???Wood chastised TURN for supporting utility divestiture of generating plants as California's deregulation effort got under way. And he said Hoge places too much emphasis on the utilities' role in the energy mess instead of focusing on the profiteering of power generators. ???""The utilities have some culpability, but they are not the main driver behind the crisis,"" Wood said. ""TURN's interventions do not reflect that reality."" ???Still, he gave TURN high marks and credited Hoge with making it a far more effective advocate. ???Hoge admits she has had her hands full with the energy crisis, saying she and her staff ""are trying to keep our health and sanity."" ???Asked if she would have joined TURN if she had known how crazy California's energy market would become and how hard she would have to work, Hoge was characteristically wary. ???""I don't think anyone would want to sign up for this,"" she said after a moment's pause. ""On the one hand, it's very serious, very rewarding work. But on the other hand, sometimes you're just beating your head against the wall."" ???Still, Hoge doesn't plan to give up the fight anytime soon. ???""But at some point I'd like to retreat and spend some time contemplating the forest for the trees."" ???Or the garden for the plants. ??Nettie Hoge -- Age: 50. ???-- Residence: Oakland. ???-- Job: Executive director, The Utility Reform Network, October 1995 to present.

A03 LENGTH: 1669 words HEADLINE: Energy Forecast for Summer: No Blackouts but Price Spikes; Grid Managers Promote Conservation, Await New Plants BYLINE: William Claiborne, Washington Post Staff Writer DATELINE: CHICAGO BODY: ??The rest of the United States is virtually certain to escape rolling blackouts this summer like the ones that have plagued California, but record price hikes for electricity are likely in many places, energy experts agree. ???Despite their confidence that they can survive everything but an extremely hot summer without power outages, managers of the nation's interconnecting electrical power grids are anxiously awaiting new power plants that are scheduled to come on-line. They are also promoting more frugal consumption by power customers and seeking ways to avoid distribution logjams during peak demand periods this summer. ???""We see a big distinction between California and the rest of the country,"" said David Costello, an economist in charge of short-term forecasting for the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy. ""We have no real reason to believe anyplace is unusually at risk."" ???But record spikes in the price of electricity are a given for this summer, some industry analysts say, because a growing proportion of power plants now run on natural gas, which has doubled in price over the past year. ???The DOE estimates that electricity demand will grow 2.3 percent nationally this year, with much higher increases in the West and the South. At the same time, the reserve capacity margin that utilities try to build into their systems to handle the hottest days -- when use of air conditioners and other appliances taxes supplies -- has been falling in some regions to well less than the desired 15 percent above peak summer loads. ???That means utilities may have to import large volumes of electricity over transmission systems that were not designed to handle them. What power officials are hoping to avoid are critical shortfalls in generating capacity in some regions, followed by overwhelming strains on aging high-voltage transmission lines as power is bought and sold across the country in increasingly competitive electricity markets. ???Even though scores of new power plants have been built in the Northeast, South and Midwest in recent months and many more are on the drawing boards, the expected 15 percent increase in new generation will not be fully on-line for another two years. That leaves parts of the nation vulnerable to outages if there are prolonged heat waves this summer, or if utilities are unable to start up new or rebuilt gas-fired power plants as scheduled, according to energy experts. ???Despite all those potential problems, there is no reason to believe that California's power nightmares will spread to the rest of the country, officials said. ???This year, utilities have announced they are adding 40 to 50 gigawatts of new generating capacity to gas-fired plants across the nation, compared with only 22 gigawatts that were added last year, Costello said. He said that even if half of those announced plants never materialize, this year's new capacity is certain to be as great or greater than last year's, meaning that the predicted increased consumption can probably be met. A gigawatt is 1,000 megawatts, or enough to power about 1 million homes. ???""We don't know that [transmission] infrastructure has really been fixed, but my sense is they're in better shape overall as far as capacity is concerned,"" Costello said. ???The nation's 203,600-mile high-voltage network has undergone relatively few changes in 50 years, during which deregulation has prompted electricity wholesalers to sell power at even greater distances to reach more lucrative markets, adding to the pressure on the grid system. ???California, in a sense, has been serving as a stalking horse for other states, some of which also deregulated their electricity systems and are consciously avoiding doing anything that resembles the California model. ???Eugene Gorzelnik, spokesman for the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), which oversees the interlocking power grids, said: ""Obviously, there will be problems in California and there's nothing that's going on that will solve those problems. But a lot of [utilities] people are looking at California and saying to themselves, 'Can I do this in a way they didn't?' That's a positive development."" ???Apart from California, the worst problems are expected in adjoining western states, as Golden State electrical grid managers scramble to buy electricity at a time when power production at the region's hydroelectric dams is already being cut because of shrinking water levels in reservoirs. ???The Northwest Power Planning Council recently reported that the demand for electricity has grown 24 percent in the past decade while new generation has grown only 4 percent. ???NERC is not expected to issue its long-awaited pre-summer electricity reliability assessment -- a document that forecasts peak generation and consumption -- until next month. But in interviews, officials of many of the 10 regional reliability councils that comprise the national grid system appeared fairly sanguine about the prospect of avoiding widespread brownouts this summer. ???""Assuming normal weather and assuming our generating units come off maintenance on schedule, we don't anticipate any particular problems meeting our loads,"" said Bill Reinke, executive director of the Southeastern Electricity Reliability Council. ???Reinke said the region was adding 300 miles of new transmission lines, has 5,600 megawatts of new generating capacity -- enough to power 5.6 million homes -- and is seeking to identify potential transmission bottlenecks so it can take preemptive corrective measures against distribution failures. ???Outside the West, the greatest potential for blackouts may be in New York, where the near certainty of transmission logjams in an antiquated infrastructure prompted Consolidated Edison Co. to request approval for 11 combustion turbine mini-generators in case of a power shortage. Residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental grounds. ???Stephen Allen, spokesman for the Northeast Power Coordinating Council said, ""If the 400 megawatts the generators provide go on-line, it'll still be tight, but New York should be okay."" He said Upstate New York should have surplus electricity to sell to New York City, although some experts say transmission bottlenecks could make it difficult for New York City to import power on abnormally hot days. ???New York City customers, who have already had their electricity rates increased 40 percent in the last two years, could see prices rise an additional 50 percent because of the deregulated power industry's dependence on gas-fired generation, according to some analysts. ???Allen said that since last June, New England has added mostly gas-fired plants that generate more than 1,000 megawatts and should have an additional 2,000 megawatts on-line before the end of the summer. He said the region should have a 15 percent to 18 percent capacity margin. ???The Mid-Atlantic Area Council, made up of Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, is expecting a reserve margin of more than 16 percent and an increase of 2,100 megawatts in generating capacity over last year, to about 60,000 megawatts, according to the council's president, Phillip G. Harris. Harris said the council met last year's peak of 49,288 megawatts with no problems, though the summer of 2000 was relatively cool. ???Harris cited several reasons ""why we are not like California,"" including a decision to centralize all planning, which California did not; the creation of a regional market instead of a state-based marketplace like California's, and a policy of only slow, incremental changes in the grid. ???""A single misstep can have huge consequences,"" Harris said. ""We're tinkering with something that has worked for 100 years, so you better do it right."" ???In the Midwest, utilities expect a peak demand this summer of 55,221 megawatts, compared with 52,214 megawatts last summer, according to Richard Bulley, executive director of the six-state Mid-America Interconnected Network. But keeping pace with the nearly 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity, Bulley said. ???""We do not anticipate any major limitations on the region's bulk transmission system, and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than 18 percent,"" he said. ???Since 1998, 33 companies have proposed projects in Illinois totaling 25,000 megawatts of gas-fired power. Although no one expects all of that to come on-line, the state's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts, meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated power was added, the region would have a cushion, even in a hot summer. ???Officials of Commonwealth Edison Co., the biggest utility in Illinois, say that new or rebuilt electrical distribution facilities should prevent a repeat of the kind of disastrous power outages that crippled offices in Chicago's Loop last summer, when lines broke and transformers burst into flames. ???Few power grids are in as good shape as Texas's. The state anticipates a 23 percent power margin this summer and the addition of 9,188 megawatts of new generating capacity this year, according to Heather Tindall, spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Texas utilities have 27 new power plants under construction and 31 more in the planning stages, she said. ???As a result, ERCOT is forecasting almost 70,000 megawatts of generating capacity this summer, compared with a peak demand of 57,600 megawatts on one 111-degree day last summer. ???Tindall said that after studying California's system, the Texas grid made a ""concerted effort"" to operate theirs differently. For example, she said, Texas supports utilities entering into long-term contracts for power, while in California, power companies did not enter into such contracts and were forced to pay exorbitant prices at peak times.

Gray Davis calls a federal regulatory order ""a Trojan horse"" that will profit power generators at California ratepayers' expense. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is considering requiring the state's electric grid operator to add a surcharge on power sales to pay generators the money they are owed by the state's two large financially strapped utilities. ??- State power buyers have asked for another $500 million to buy electricity for the customers of three cash-strapped utilities. That brings the total amount authorized for power purchases to $6.2 billion since mid-January, when the state began purchases power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??- Gov. Gray Davis says state office buildings cut energy use by an average of 20 percent in January and February, saving taxpayers $286,000 in utility bills. ??- State officials negotiating long-term power contracts for customers of three cash-strapped utilities have secured five more contracts. Four of the contracts signed in March by the Department of Water Resources will provide 466 megawatts of electricity during times of peak demand this summer, according to DWR documents. One megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes. ??- California Public Utilities Commission attorneys are advising state agencies to avoid submitting monetary claims against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. despite the company's bankruptcy. The PUC is trying to retain their electric rate-setting authority over the utility and says submitting claims could bring the state under the court's jurisdiction as a creditor, which could allow the judge to set electric rates. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $9.90, up 15 cents. PG&E Corp. closed at $8.94, up 20 cents. ??-The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates as much as 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

The 350-degree steam rushes more than 1,500 feet up from the earth, spinning turbines that create a constant flow of electricity. ??But mismanagement of the steam fields beneath the hilly northwestern California region that straddles the Sonoma and Lake county lines has led to a large decline of pressure and a drop of more than 50 percent in the amount of power the plants produce. ??The geothermal decline comes as California already faces short supplies of hydroelectricity from the drought-ridden Pacific Northwest and growing competition for megawatts from other power-starved states. ??State power grid managers estimate they're losing about 900 megawatts of geothermal electricity due to the gradual depletion of the steam fields. That's enough power for roughly 675,000 homes. ??''They just overproduced. It is a renewable source of power, but it's renewable over geologic time,'' says Katherine Potter, a spokeswoman for Calpine Energy, which owns 19 of the 21 geothermal power plants in The Geysers region, which incidentally has no geysers. ??The first electricity produced by tapping into pockets of steam trapped in the earth made its debut in 1904 in Larderello, Italy. That plant, rebuilt due to World War II damage, is still operating. The first U.S. geothermal plant was a small operation at The Geysers built in 1962. ??Steam fields are created when water flows through fissures in the rock deep in the earth and is heated by hot magma. Geothermal plants tap into that pressure and use it to spin turbines. The plants' cooling towers release plumes of white steam, which can be seen for miles on a clear day. ??While The Geysers is a unique geologic formation called a dry steam field, there is the potential for thousands of megawatts of geothermal power from other regions that could use the more common ''wet steam'' process, said Karl Gawell, executive director of the Geothermal Energy Association in Washington D.C. ??Wet steam plants tap into superheated water in the earth, separate the steam and use it to power generators. The water and the condensed steam is pumped back into the earth. ??CalEnergy Corp. owns 10 power plants in Imperial County that produce about 330 megawatts of power, enough for about 247,500 homes. Those plants and others like them haven't seen a decline in pressure like Calpine's plants. ??Geothermal energy is second only to hydroelectricity as a continuous, cheap source of power, said Jan Stewart, Calpine's public relations manager. ??The plants in The Geysers reached their peak power production in the 1980s, producing about 2,000 megawatts of electricity enough to power about 1.5 million homes. ??At that time, about 30 companies were involved in various geothermal ventures in the area and didn't work together, Stewart said. ??''The resource wasn't being managed properly. As a result, it was a very fractured environment,'' she said. ''If one plant shut down, the steam would be vented to the atmosphere, instead of being rerouted to another plant where it could be used.'' ??In the 1960s and '70s when The Geysers got started, there was ''a real wildcatter's mentality'' among power generators, said Rich Ferguson, energy chairman for Sierra Club California. ??''Basically, they took out the water in the form of steam faster than Mother Nature was putting it back in,'' he said. ??The available steam declined, and the area now puts out about 850 megawatts, sufficient power for roughly 637,500 homes. ??Since then, geothermal engineers have learned more about managing the resource, Ferguson said. ??The superheated, self-contained system at The Geysers has no ??ater running through it. ?''The Geysers is unique worldwide. There really aren't other dry steam fields,'' Gawell said. ''In effect, there was never a sustainable level of production, you always would have depleted it eventually. It's like a giant pressure cooker. As soon as you put the first straw in, you began to deplete the resource.'' ??Calpine is experimenting with replenishing the steam fields by pumping treated waste water back into the earth. It began three years ago, when Lake County stopped pumping its treated waste water into Clear Lake. ??Now, more than 8 million gallons of treated waste water is returned daily to the earth. The experiment appears to be working _ power output is up 68 megawatts. ??''People like the stewardship that Calpine provides now,'' Ferguson said. '' Calpine has taken on as a long-term goal to make that sustainable.'' ??Calpine is building a 50-mile pipeline to Santa Rosa and plans to pump another 11 million of treated waste water daily from that city. The company expects that will boost production another 85 megawatts. ??Even with the new project, power grid managers say they're planning for diminishing geothermal electricity. ??''We've lost a considerable portion of their output due to the decline in the output of the steam,'' said Jim McIntosh, director of grid operations for the Independent System Operator. ''All supplies are very important to us at this point.'' ??The plants are relatively low-maintenance once they're running _ only one engineer staffs each of the 19 Calpine plants in The Geysers. ??But geothermal plants are more expensive to build than natural gas-fired power plants, Gaywell said. ??''It's like choosing between two identical cars one is $10,000 and the other is $30,000, but the $30,000 car comes with a lifetime supply of fuel,'' he said. ''People are shortsighted on investments and it takes more money upfront to build geothermal.'' ??Most geothermal resources are on public land, lengthening the building process because more permits are needed, Gawell said. ??Two new plants are in the application process in California. ??Researchers estimate there are 2,500 megawatts of untapped geothermal resources in Nevada, Gawell said. Idaho, New Mexico and Oregon also have sites that could be tapped, he said. ??''Many of these sites were looked at in the '80s, but then nothing happened because in the '90s natural gas was too cheap to meter,'' he said. ??Ferguson said the state spent $540 million over the last four years on incentives for renewable energy projects, including geothermal, solar, wind and biomass, and he expects the plan will be renewed when it expires in December. ??''We think there will be an equivalent amount of money,'' he said. ''All the technologies have to compete against each other, but geothermal should do pretty good.'' ??___ ??There are three types of geothermal power plants. Here's a look at how they work: ???Dry steam: Such plants are rare, producing steam and not hot water. The Geysers region is the world's largest dry steam field. Steam from the earth is piped to the power plant, where it spins turbines to create electricity. After the remaining steam condenses back to liquid, it is returned to the earth. ???Wet steam: This type of geothermal plant is more common. There are several such plants in Southern California. Hot water and steam are brought to the surface, separated and the steam is used to power turbines. The water is returned to the earth as is the condensed steam. ???Binary: These plants use hot water and steam from the earth to heat another liquid, such as isobutane, which has a lower boiling point than water. That liquid's steam is used to power turbines to make electricity. When the steam cools and becomes liquid it's returned to the tank and reused. This type of system is self-contained and has no emissions. ??___ ??On the Net: ??Geothermal Education Office: http://geothermal.marin.org ??California ISO: http://www.caiso.com ??Calpine Corp.: http://www.calpine.com ?????(PROFILE ?????(CO:Calpine Corp; TS:CPN; IG:ELC;) ?????)

BODY: ??Backers of a bill to prevent holders of concealed handgun licenses from bringing their weapons onto school property will spend the coming week trying to force a Senate vote on the issue. ??Also this week, House Speaker Mark Simmons is planning to schedule a hearing on his bill to pull the plug - at least for now - on a key part of an electric deregulation law that's due to take effect this fall for large businesses. ??The guns-in-schools bill has been on life support for weeks, with a key Senate committee chairman refusing to schedule a hearing on the bill on grounds that it is overly contentious and wouldn't pass anyway. ??The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Ryan Deckert, D-Beaverton, and other supporters aren't giving up, however. ??They are hoping to use a parliamentary maneuver that would enable them to move the school guns issue to the full Senate for debate by attaching it to another education-related bill. ??Gun owner groups say SB508 is unnecessary because there have been no documented cases of law-abiding carriers of concealed handguns causing any problems at schools. ??But a key supporter of the bill, Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, says she is convinced the measure would pass in both the House and Senate - if it can be brought up for vote. ??""I don't think we should wait to have dead children before we ban guns in schools,"" said Burdick, who was a chief sponsor of a measure passed by voters last fall expanding background checks at gun shows. ??California's power woes that were precipitated by that state's move to deregulation are giving Oregon lawmakers second thoughts about their decision to approve a phased-in deregulation of the electricity market in Oregon. ??A bill passed by the 1999 Legislature is supposed to open Oregon's electric markets to industrial and large commercial customers, beginning this October. ??The 1999 law is supposed to free large businesses to buy power on the open market, and does not deregulate electric rates for residential customers. ??Still, Simmons says that drought conditions and the power market turmoil caused by California's energy crisis require reconsideration of the law. ??For that reason, the House speaker is planning hearings this week on his proposal to enact a 15-month delay in Oregon's electricity restructuring efforts. ??""This just gives the opportunity for the energy markets to settle for a while,"" the Elgin Republican said. ??Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.

Tierney, a former assistant secretary in the Energy Department, now a consultant for Lexecon, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm. ??Like planets lining up to usher in an age of hysteria, a combination of unforeseen circumstances have put the Northwest behind the eight ball. In addition to California's self-created tangle, oil and natural gas prices are rising and a drought is stymieing the region's hydropower production. ??The situation is less volatile in other parts of the country. In the Northeast, South and Midwest, where growth has been modest and generating capacity has been more stable, there's less discrepancy between supply and demand. ??Undergirding the West's situation was some serious lack of foresight, Tierney said. ??When it looked like California power customers would be able to get electricity from whoever offered it at the cheapest price, utilities worried about recovering the money they'd spent building plants and transmission lines in the '70s and early '80s. So they sold off their power plants and bought power on the wholesale market, where it was cheap and plentiful. ??Not trusting the marketplace, California legislators capped the rates utilities could charge residential customers. When wholesale power prices went up, they couldn't pass those increases on to consumers. ??""At the time, they did not realize that in a couple of years there would not be an adequate power supply,"" Tierney said. ??California's economic explosion of the late '90s, coupled with a failure to build any new plants, brought the crisis to a head. Computers are not by themselves big energy consumers, but the factories that make them are. The Internet, with all its server farms and data hotels, also became a heavy power user. ??When demand in California finally caught up with supply, ""all of a sudden, utilities had to buy power, and it became a seller's market,"" Tierney said. ??But most of the Northwest's power comes from hydroelectric dams, and there has to be water in the rivers to power the turbines at the dams. In a drought year like this, the power has to come from somewhere else, most likely oil- and natural gas-fired plants, which fire up when demand is high. ??Because demand is so high this year, generators can charge exorbitant prices, knowing that California and the Northwest have nowhere else to buy power. ??Also, natural gas prices have gone through the roof in the last 18 months and aren't likely to come down until next year at the earliest. Until 18 months ago, the price of natural gas had been at a prolonged low, so companies weren't interested in expensive drilling projects. ??The problem is not likely to be permanent. As exploration and extraction pick up, prices will come down. The public has already begun to hear a conservation message, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is being deluged with applications for new power plant construction. ??Staff writer Paul Menser can be reached at 542-6752, or via e-mail at pmenser@idahonews.com.

FROM THE ENERGY CRISIS BYLINE: JEFF STANSBURY, Jeff Stansbury is a PhD candidate in American history at UCLA. His, dissertation is on the role of the labor movement in the building of, L.A.'s infrastructure BODY: ??Why is Los Angeles an island of tranquillity in the electric-power crisis that has rocked California and threatens to spread across the nation? ??News stories have repeatedly told us that the city's ownership and operation of its own generating stations is the principal reason. By staying clear of the state's 1996 deregulation scheme for private utilities, the Department of Water and Power was able to hold onto its power plants. ??So far, so good. But when we ask how Los Angeles came to enjoy public power in the first place, the answer commonly given makes a hash of history. ??Most historians and political scientists credit the city's progressive reform movement of 1890-1915 for having wisely settled on a municipal utility. True, some of the entrepreneurs, lawyers and reform-minded professionals who called themselves ""the best men"" during that era agitated for the city-built Owens Valley aqueduct and its generating stations. But many reformers opposed the city's effort to distribute its own power. Because they had allied themselves with railway magnate Henry Huntington, who owned an electric company, or because they favored regulation over municipal ownership, they wanted L.A.'s three private electric companies to sell and profit from aqueduct power. Meyer Lissner, a reform attorney often portrayed as a champion of public power, opposed the holding of a decisive 1911 citywide straw poll on the subject because he knew most Angelenos would cast their ballots for municipal ownership. That, he said, would be ""unfair"" to the three utilities. ??The most steadfast partisans of public power were not progressive reformers like Lissner but the city's much-maligned labor unions, and for a simple reason. While mistrust of oligopoly ran through nearly all sectors of society, it burned hottest in working-class wards. Without organized labor's dogged campaign for ""gas and water socialism,"" as well as its willingness to hand control of these resources to the anti-union regimes of Mayors George Alexander and Henry Rose, there would be no DWP today. ??Organized labor played a key role in the city's original decision to municipalize its water distribution system. On Oct. 24, 1892, 700 union members met to demand that the city build a small neighborhood waterworks as a step toward public control of the entire water supply. From that day on, L.A.'s unions never wavered in their call for a public water supply publicly managed. They mobilized the rank and file for the water-company buyouts of 1901-04, and, in 1906, the Public Ownership Party's citywide campaign primed voters to pour $ 23 million into construction of the Owens River aqueduct a year later. The aqueduct was the sine qua non of public power. At a time when most progressive reformers were mute on the subject, organized labor insisted that the aqueduct be used to generate electricity for the city's streets, homes and businesses. ??A broad consensus backed the city's construction of hydroelectric plants while the aqueduct was being built, but most of the city's politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed to public subsidies, not public ownership, of aqueduct power. The 1911 straw poll, in which city voters declared their support for municipal ownership and distribution of Owens River power, upset their plans. ??The most consistent fighters for public power during the decades after the straw poll were the Central Labor Council, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, other unions and city employees who stuffed campaign envelopes, canvassed precincts and got out the vote. Voters who favored municipally owned power and initiatives bolstering the DWP tended to be working class and Democratic; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class and Republican. ??In this polarized political climate, Mayor Alexander called for a $ 6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct-power distribution network; he left open the question of who would sell the power to consumers. Unions and socialists tied their support for the bonds to a city charter reform that would guarantee them a long-sought role in city government through proportional representation. When the reform failed at the polls, they withheld support from the power bonds, and these, too, went down to defeat in 1913. Much of the rancor workers felt was aimed at progressives like Lissner, head of the Good Government Organization, who fought labor's charter plank because it would bring socialists onto the City Council. ??The labor movement's dedication to public ownership soon reasserted itself, however. With a citywide election coming up that June, five unionists seeking council seats on the Socialist Party ticket revived labor's long-standing demand for city operation of all public utilities at cost. They urged the City Council to hold a new power-bond election with a clear public ownership mandate. They attacked the power companies' efforts to buy aqueduct power from the city and sell it to Angelenos at a profit. Soon, the great majority of unions in the Central Labor Council were locked in what turned out to be a decisive struggle against the power oligopoly made up of Southern California Edison, Pacific Light & Power and Los Angeles Gas & Electric. ??An unprecedented event brightened the bonds' chances. A machinist, Fred C. Wheeler, won a seat on the City Council, the first unionist to do so in the 20th century. Wheeler led a successful fight against an attempt to split the power-bond issue into two separate ballot propositions, one to complete the aqueduct's generating stations, the other to create a city-owned distribution system. Such a division would probably have doomed public power. ??The large majority of unionists who favored public power had little time to savor Wheeler's victory. While pressing the attack on the three electric companies, they faced a small but angry split in their own ranks. Dissenters in the Building Trades Council and a few of its unions argued that labor's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909-14 had turned the argument for municipal ownership on its head. What good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had caused the arrest of hundreds of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910, had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had denied unionists influential city jobs? The final blow was the council's rebuff of a petition signed by thousands of workers for a ""living wage"" law. Was it not folly to reward labor's foes with control of the aqueduct's power? ??Union activists who favored the bonds conceded that the dissenters were correct in their assessment of ""progressive"" city government. But the progressive star was fading. What counted in the long run was whether Los Angeles could wrest the city's electric power system from the grasp of private utilities. The Central Labor Council's unions took this challenge to heart and voted, 60-4, for a resolution favoring the bonds. ??On its own, as well as in coalition with other groups, the labor movement marshaled its rank and file on behalf of public power. It turned out hundreds of poll-watchers and canvassers on election day. The pro-bond unions never did win over the dissenting faction; rather, they overwhelmed it at the polls. On May 8, 1914, L.A.'s voters emphatically endorsed the power bonds by a hefty 71%-29%, with the city's working-class wards providing by far the largest margin of victory. ??Within a year, Los Angeles sold its bonds and began buying out the three investor-owned utilities. The first public power flowed into local homes and businesses in 1916. Two decades later, the DWP eliminated the last of its private competition and consolidated the working-class legacy of kilowatt and water socialism that has served the city so well in the current energy crisis.

BODY: ??Natural disasters and crises can be devastating but are relatively simple and easy to grasp. A brush fire you fight with shovels. An earthquake, you clean up the rubble afterward and strengthen buildings in anticipation of the next. But California's energy crisis is far different and more complex. It's a quiet disaster on scattered, invisible fronts. Most people see it only when their own lights go out. ??There also is no precedent for this crisis in California and no accurate way to forecast how bad it can get, either the blackouts or the financial consequences. But as May approaches, it's certain that most Californians are not adequately informed about the severity of the problem or what they can do to limit its impact. ??Gov. Gray Davis, the utilities and others need to engage in a crash education program that will convince Californians of the seriousness of the problem and motivate them to undertake their own conservation programs in homes and businesses. California has been a pioneer in power conservation, and its citizens will listen to persuasive reasoning. ??As the chairwoman of the state Senate's Energy Committee, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) deals with problems ranging from utility company insolvency to rate ""gaming"" by energy producers. ""But I'm really worried about this summer,"" she said last week, referring to the potential for day after day of rolling blackouts. She told of one businessman in her district who reported he will lose an estimated $ 30,000 every time his power is cut. Why not at least schedule blackouts so people can plan for them? she asked. Why not? ??In San Francisco, the Bay Area Economic Forum released a study indicating that power woes could deliver a $ 17-billion blow to the state's economy in lost production, the cost of rate increases and increased product prices. That may be conservative. The study did not include the $ 5.1 billion the state has spent so far to buy power for the insolvent private utilities. ??Republicans in the Legislature are stalling bills that would float a $ 10-billion revenue bond issue to finance power purchases and keep the state fiscally above water. They have latched onto a powerful issue, Davis' unwillingness to detail how he's spending the taxpayers' billions. Davis says he needs secrecy for competitive reasons as he bargains with power companies, though he is letting out a slightly wider trickle of figures. ??Wall Street, already wary about the credit-worthiness of the state, thinks poorly of the delay in issuing the bonds. Republicans should put a temporary hold on their battle with Davis and get the measure to the governor's desk this week. ??Lawmakers were slow in passing an $ 850-million conservation program, Bowen acknowledges. But Davis put the new program on a fast track Friday and made a smart choice in S. David Freeman, former chief of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to run the conservation effort. ??Freeman, 75, is a canny veteran of electric power politics. Davis may abhor giving out bad news, but Freeman need not shrink from it. Freeman should be on radio and television every day telling California just how bad the problem is and what they can do about it. If this were a flood, we'd be stacking sandbags. Our sandbags are conservation programs. We need to start stacking them now.

BYLINE: RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: WASHINGTON BODY: ??So what if President Bush has opposed electricity price controls sought by California officials? Or that he has proposed cutting aid to states for incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of crimes? Or that he has visited 26 states in his first 100 days in office--but not the most populous? ??Bush really does care about California, the White House insists, even if the state preferred Al Gore on election day. Administration officials said they have done a lot and plan to do more to lessen the electricity turmoil expected this summer. ??""I don't think he's treated California any differently than any other state,"" said Rep. George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa). ??Some Californians feel otherwise. ??""The Bush administration's treatment of California started at indifference, moved to neglect and has now reached actual harm,"" complained Phil Schiliro, chief of staff for Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has asked three times for a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis. Her response from the White House: a form letter with her name misspelled. ??Bush has called for requiring public agencies to buy costly earthquake insurance, a measure opposed by California lawmakers of both parties. He has proposed cutting an earthquake preparedness program. And he provided no money in his proposed budget to clean up a pile of uranium processing waste in Utah leaking into the Colorado River. ??""That's our water supply,"" political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said. ""What kind of message is that?"" ??John J. Pitney Jr., associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said Bush's apparent indifference makes political sense. ??""It's hard to argue that Bush should spend any political capital in California,"" he said. ""The 2000 election suggested that he cannot carry the state no matter how hard he tries. The Republicans have already lost several House seats and have probably hit rock bottom. . . . From a purely political angle, there's little point in giving California any money or attention that could otherwise go to more competitive states, such as Florida."" ??But Jeffe, senior scholar at USC's School of Policy, Planning and Development, said Bush's failure to visit the state is hurting GOP efforts to rebuild itself in California. ""We are ground zero for the kind of Latino outreach that he said he wanted to do."" ??And veteran California Republican political strategist Kenneth L. Khachigian said Bush at least needs to prepare for the electricity problems predicted for summer. ??""If you get three or four days of successive blackouts, air conditioners going out, traffic lights going out, a second bankruptcy--whether he wants it or not--it's his problem,"" Khachigian said. ""It would be wise for him to have a proactive stance, not just reactive."" ??Tough Act to Follow ??Some political analysts have suggested that if Bush becomes too involved in California's troubles, what is now Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' problem could become Bush's. But, Khachigian said, ""there's a fine line between taking responsibility for a problem and claiming that California isn't part of the United States."" ??In dealing with heavily Democratic California, Bush has made this much clear: He is no Bill Clinton. ??Bush has a hard act to follow. When Clinton was president, he visited California often and rewarded it with federal largess. And California in return showered him with buckets of campaign dollars and electoral votes. ??But Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) said California will benefit from Bush's presidency too. ""As Californians bear a disproportionately higher tax burden, they stand to benefit greatly from the president's tax relief plan."" ??While House spokeswoman Claire Buchan assured that Bush will visit California soon. His wife already has done so. ??As proof that California is on their mind, administration officials point to the three Californians in the Cabinet--Ann M. Veneman of Agriculture, Norman Y. Mineta of Transportation and Anthony J. Principi of Veterans Affairs--and others in top White House jobs. ??Bush also has appointed California Latinos to high-level posts: Huntington Park Councilwoman Rosario Marin as treasurer, Los Angeles entrepreneur Hector V. Barreto Jr. as head of the Small Business Administration and former San Mateo County Supervisor Ruben Barrales as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs. ??Critics said that a Californian at the top does not guarantee that the Cabinet departments will develop California-friendly policies. The proposed Agriculture budget, for example, provides only $ 5 million--not the $ 15 million that California lawmakers said they need--to fight the glassy winged sharpshooter, an agricultural pest that threatens the state's wine industry. ??A spokesman for Veneman assured that additional funding will be considered, if requested by California lawmakers. And Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), who assailed Bush for missing opportunities to help California, nonetheless expressed confidence in Veneman. ""She's going to keep pounding away to make sure that the California wine industry gets what it needs."" ??Some Good News ??Though he has proposed cuts in some programs that are important to California, Bush has taken some actions that please state officials. He has proposed a permanent research and development tax credit--an action that would particularly benefit Silicon Valley. ??His proposed budget includes additional money to crack down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling and unsafe trucks crossing into California from Mexico. And he has proposed increased funding to reduce backlogs at immigration offices. ??In one area, Bush even bested Clinton. He proposed $ 14 million to clean Lake Tahoe, more than the $ 3 million recommended by Clinton last year. ??And although he has drawn flak for proposing cuts in programs to promote energy efficiency and alternative fuels, his proposal to boost assistance to low-income families for insulating their homes and reducing their utility bills would nearly double California's allocation, to $ 8 million next year. ??No Bush policy has been more criticized in California than his approach to the state's energy woes--particularly his adamant opposition to price controls. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said Bush and his aides ""got off to a strong start"" by extending federal orders sought by the state to keep power flowing into California. ??""Since then . . . they've been AWOL,"" Maviglio said. In a reference to price controls, he added: ""They're skirting around the edges of the problem without taking the bold action they need to take."" ??""The feds are the only ones who can step in and bring some sanity to the cost of electricity in California,"" Thompson said. ??Administration officials said they have taken steps ""from our first hours in office"" to address the energy crisis. They said they have responded favorably to all the state's requests except price controls, which Bush contends would discourage the building of power plants. ??While some seek to portray Bush's opposition to price controls as unsympathetic to California's plight, a number of California's House Republicans also oppose price controls. And even those who support them argue that the issue misses the larger point. ??Rep. Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham (R-San Diego), an advocate of price controls, nevertheless said: ""I agree with the administration that the state alone remains responsible for solving this crisis."" ??Added Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs): ""I don't believe Bush should bear the brunt of responsibility that the Clinton administration left over."" ??Tim Ransdell, executive director of the California Institute for Federal Policy Research, doubted that Bush would ignore California.

Economic Growth a Welcome Surprise: The U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 2% annual rate in the first three months of the year, thanks largely to buoyant shopping by American consumers. The gross domestic product--the country's total output of goods and services--expanded at twice the pace it did in the final three months of 2000 and at twice what analysts had expected, the government said Friday. Although many analysts said the economy remains balanced between strong growth and recession, economic optimists exulted over the report. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan added to the celebratory mood by saying that a key trend behind the economy's strong performance of the last decade--its ability to improve productivity--is likely to resume despite the current slowdown. ??(Peter Gosselin) ??* ??2.

Power Crisis Zaps State Bond Rating; Price Controls OKd: The mounting cost to the state general fund of buying electricity for California consumers prompted Standard & Poor's Corp. to downgrade $ 25 billion of California's general obligation bonds. S&P lowered California's bond rating by two notches, to A-plus from AA. The move could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the state's borrowing costs, bond experts said. Separately, federal regulators approved a plan to control electricity prices in California during times of supply shortages. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tied prices during power emergencies to the cost of natural gas and emission controls, among other things, with the least efficient generator setting the market price. Critics said the order contains loopholes that will allow market manipulation. ??(Nancy Rivera Brooks) ??* ??4. FTC Pans Music Industry Marketing: A much-anticipated sequel to last year's Federal Trade Commission report on the marketing of violent entertainment to children slammed the record industry for failing to heed regulators' recommendations. Though it gave some credit to the film and video-game industries for revising the way they marketed to young audiences, the FTC found the five major record conglomerates continued to advertise ""explicit-content"" albums on popular teen shows such as MTV's ""Total Request Live"" and BET's ""Top 10 Live."" Just before the release of the first report, the Recording Industry Assn. of America had blunted some of the criticism by introducing a policy against ads for such albums on TV shows or in publications whose audience is mostly 16 years old or younger. But the RIAA said it rescinded the policy in September. ??(Jeff Leeds) ??* ??5. Gas Prices Continue Upward Spiral: The average price of self-serve regular gasoline spurted higher again in California and around the nation on an increase in demand and a switch by refiners to the more costly summer gasoline blend required in parts of the country by air-quality regulations. Prices in California got an extra boost from a fire at a Los Angeles-area refinery owned by Tosco Corp. and by a change in Tosco's pricing strategy. In late March, Tosco increased wholesale prices to its dealers in Southern California and Arizona and tied prices to the cost of gasoline in the spot market. Some other major suppliers have begun matching the Tosco increase, market experts said. Some market watchers foresee gas at $ 3 a gallon or more. ??(Nancy Rivera Brooks) ??* ??6.

Disney Earnings Beat Estimates: Walt Disney Co.'s second-quarter operating results exceeded Wall Street's expectations as the company's studio and consumer products units improved, although Disney did post a net loss stemming largely from a one-time charge related to the restructuring of its Internet portal. Disney also confirmed that it will shrink its venerable animation unit, with a union official estimating as many as 300 jobs of about 1,000 in Burbank could be cut. Separately, President Robert Iger confirmed that layoffs will be needed to reach Disney's previously announced goal of cutting 4,000 jobs companywide. Disney's studio and consumer products groups showed improved results in the quarter, while earnings were flat in its theme parks and softer in broadcasting. ??(James Bates) ??* ??8.

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried ""Wolf!"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. ??But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state -- and nobody will believe it. ???True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. ??But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators ""gaming the system"" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently -- and very profitably -- short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. ??As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that ""generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market"" -- a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. ??Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say ""apparently"" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey -- the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls -- voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. ??What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions -- ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard-to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not. ??Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls ""megawatt laundering"" -- selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to ""imports"" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: ""I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."" ??The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts -- but FERC has ignored all of them. ??The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan ""a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout"" from the looming disaster. ??Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2001 of 103 DOCUMENTS ??????????????????Copyright 2001 McClatchy Newspapers, Inc.

A1; POWER CRUNCH LENGTH: 1323 words HEADLINE: Diesel plants spark concern They're expected to generate big air-quality problems when predicted summer blackouts hit. BYLINE: Chris Bowman and Stuart Leavenworth Bee Staff Writers BODY: ??When blackouts roll across California in the coming months - as captains of the crippled electricity grid say they surely will - tens of thousands of miniature powerhouses will whine, cough and rumble to the rescue. ??These backup plants will ignite the same fuel that powers locomotives, ships and 18-wheel trucks. And they'll be spewing the same pollution - only more so, because most are old, with little or no emissions controls. ??They are diesel-powered generators, the dirtiest of internal combustion engines. And unlike trucks and other vehicles, they've largely escaped 30 years of air pollution restrictions because they were intended only for emergencies, as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power. ??But, now, as a season of multiple planned blackouts appears imminent, many California businesses are expected to fire up the old stogies more often than was ever imagined. ??And the generators will kick in when their expelled gases can do the most harm. The hot weather that taxes air conditioners and drains electricity supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas, the ingredient in smog that inflames airways and impairs breathing. ??""That is why we think this is going to be the most challenging summer ever for air quality,"" said Luna Salaver, spokeswoman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, a nine-county region with thousands of unregulated standby generators. ??""On those hot days when we want people to stop driving and doing things that pollute the air, the generators will kick in, and air quality will worsen,"" Salaver said. ??No one knows how many diesel generators are scattered around the state at hospitals, universities, factories and businesses. But air districts report there are at least 641 in Sacramento; up to 5,000 in the Bay Area; 1,200 in the San Joaquin Valley; and thousands more in the smog-plagued valleys of Southern California. ??Some are relatively clean, particularly if they have been built or retrofitted in the last few years. But most are tiny pollution factories, and were intended only to be run for short periods following natural disasters. ??According to the state Air Resources Board, a typical diesel generator emits about 50 to 100 times more smog-forming compounds per unit of energy than a typical gas-fired power plant. When the plants run for hours, people downwind can get a heavy dose of the tiny, toxic particles contained in diesel exhaust. ??""Go down to the Greyhound bus station and have them turn on their engines and hang around there - that's what it's like,"" said Michael Scheible, deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board, which regulates engines and fuels. ??Environmentalists say generators should be cranked up only during power outages. But in recent months, farmers and manufacturers have pressured regulators to redefine an emergency and allow generators to be used well before a blackout is ordered. ??Business groups say regulators need to be sensitive to data centers, chip makers and other manufacturers that can't afford even a one-second interruption in power. ??""We would like some kind of statewide policy on when and where we can use the diesel generators,"" said Gino DiCaro, a spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ""Obviously, we would like to use them more than we can now."" ??""We need to basically let go of this air-quality issue,"" said Mike Jennings, a Fresno energy consultant whose clients include members of the food-processing and dairy industries. ??State air and energy regulators are pushing energy conservation as the best way to avoid power outages. Nonetheless, the California Energy Commission has been compiling a list of generators statewide to see how their use could be coordinated, a move that stirs hope from business groups. ??""Six months ago, nobody wanted to talk about this because diesel was a big, bad word,"" DiCaro said. ""Now, at least we have agencies like the Energy Commission and the Public Utilities Commission talking about how diesel generators can fit into our electrically unreliable world."" ??Environmentalists worry that, as the summer drags on, Gov. Gray Davis will allow unrestricted use of the diesels. ??So far, the governor's staff has ""held firm,"" said Gail Ruderman Feuer, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group. ""But if blackouts start happening in a big way, they could change their tune."" ??Along with other forecasters, officials with the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's electricity grid, expect a flurry of blackouts in coming months. The next two months could be critical, because most new power plants under construction won't go on line before July. In addition, California will be losing one of its largest generators of electricity today when one of two units at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant is taken off-line for 35 days of scheduled refueling. ??""You should be ready for the worst-case scenario,"" said Del Evans, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s head of power load management, at a media briefing last week. ??For sellers and makers of diesel generators, the gloomy predictions are a gold mine. Small businesses, farmers, manufacturers - all are rushing to buy generators before the blackouts hit. ??""We are busier than we have ever been,"" said Rob Bly, president of Tuban Industrial Products Co., which assembles about 300 generators a year at its plant in Sacramento. ""We are twice as busy as we were in the height of the Y2K madness."" ??Bly says the generators he makes are ""10 times cleaner"" than ones of a decade ago. Still, he acknowledges, diesel is diesel. ??""If you are a hospital and you want standby power, you can't use propane. The fire marshall won't let you,"" said Bly. ""That leaves you with just one thing, and that is diesel."" ??Responding to such concerns, state Sen. Rico Oller, R-Andreas, introduced a bill this year to exempt thousands of backup generators from pollution controls whenever any power alert is called. The bill, however, was blocked by a Senate committee, and environmentalists say air districts have already relaxed their rules enough. ??""One of the big concerns is the cancer risk,"" Ruderman Feuer said. Air board studies, she noted, have found that a person's lifetime cancer risk increases 50 percent if he or she lives near a big diesel generator that runs 250 hours a year. ??In January, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allowed air districts to loosen their restrictions on generators. In turn, the South Coast Air Quality Management District extended the number of hours that diesel generators could be operated each year. The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District went even further, allowing businesses to run generators when state power reserves drop to 1.5 percent or when the ISO predicts blackouts anywhere in the Valley. ??The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District still requires businesses and public agencies to wait for blackouts before generators are fired up. Altogether, the district has permits for 641 generators, including major clusters at data centers and companies such as Intel. ??In the Bay Area, regulators are even more uncertain of what could happen this summer. Unlike other regions of the state, the Bay Area never required permits for diesel generators smaller than 250 horsepower. (In Sacramento, the threshold is 50 horsepower.) ??As a result, only 12 of the region's estimated 5,000 generators are subject to pollution controls. ??Salaver, the district's spokeswoman, said officials assumed the generators would be used only during earthquakes, and therefore didn't need any regulation. ??""Now, we find people are operating generators even if we are in a Stage Two alert,"" Salaver said. ""That is not what emergency generators are for."" ??* * * ??The Bee's Chris Bowman can be reached at (916) 321-1069 or cbowman@sacbee.com.

A1 LENGTH: 1544 words HEADLINE: Why Edison, PG&E split on strategy BYLINE: Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer BODY: ??One utility was more entrepreneurial, accustomed to the rough-and-tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills. ??The other was a more political animal, conversant with the language of Sacramento - and confident that negotiations and compromise with state officials could fix its problems. ??Different cultures and different circumstances sent Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on separate paths this month. Edison, run by a former president of the Public Utilities Commission, negotiated a rescue package with Gov. Gray Davis. PG&E, with fewer ties to government and possessed of an independent streak, walked away from Davis and straight into U.S. Bankruptcy Court. ??As California's energy crisis hurtles toward a summer of blackouts and higher rates, experts are debating which company found the best solution for digging its way out of billions in debt. ??""We now have two models; it'll be interesting to see who recovers the quickest,"" said Mitch Wilk, a former PUC president who is now an energy consultant in San Francisco. ??At first blush, Edison and PG&E had plenty in common. Both utilities were afflicted with the same problem: runaway wholesale electricity costs they weren't able to recover from customers because of a state-mandated rate freeze. Both had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy since January, when their losses depleted their cash reserves and credit. ??But PG&E was far sicker financially than Edison. Its debts from the state's flawed deregulation scheme reached $6.6 billion vs. $3.5 billion for Edison. That's because Edison serves a smaller territory and has more long-term supply contracts, so it was buying far less electricity than PG&E on the horrendously expensive spot market. ??Faced with a comparatively manageable loss, Edison was receptive to selling its share of California's transmission grid to the state, a deal that would generate $2.76 billion. The proceeds, along with funds from a proposed long-term bond sale, would pay off Edison's debts, according to the terms of the deal. ??Although PG&E says it was willing to sell its transmission lines, too, there was a crucial difference in the two companies' backgrounds that ultimately would influence their approach to the financial crisis. ??Unlike Edison, PG&E is a natural gas company as well as an electric company. PG&E, a subsidiary of PG&E Corp., had survived the bruising wars of natural gas deregulation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The experience took PG&E out of the cozy world of the regulated monopoly - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but was subject to state price controls - and into the world of competition. ??The experience gave PG&E more of a free-market bent, said a former PUC staffer who requested anonymity. ??So even though Davis' aides say the governor offered PG&E a plan that would have paid off its debts - including $3 billion to $4 billion for its share of the grid - the utility balked at a key provision. While the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002, Davis was insisting the utility remain regulated for a decade. ??PG&E wanted an immediate end to Public Utilities Commission regulation, and would agree only to a cursory review of rates through ""a jury-rigged arbitration,"" Davis said last week. ??""I believe PG&E was in denial,"" Davis said in an interview with Bee editors and reporters. ??PG&E says it wasn't demanding an end to regulation. Rather, what it wanted - and what Davis' negotiator Michael Peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity, said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ??In that same deal, reached Feb. 25 in Los Angeles, PG&E made a ""handshake agreement"" to sell its transmission grid, Low said. He wouldn't reveal the price. ??In the weeks that followed, the governor's team reneged, Low said. ""The discussions and negotiations broke down because they would not agree to the basic principles that were reached by (PG&E Chairman) Bob Glynn and Michael Peevey,"" Low said. ??PG&E also became disgusted with a series of PUC rulings in late March and early April that it believed would seriously hinder its ability to recover its debts. ??Things came to a head April 5 when Davis proposed a rate increase and outlined his rescue plan in a televised address. A few minutes later, Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street financier advising Davis, and other Davis advisers held a conference call in which they fleshed out the details for investors. Edison officials and directors listened in, but PG&E didn't, Fichera said. ??""They had made up their minds,"" Fichera said, referring to PG&E officials. ??The next morning, with Glynn dismissing Davis' speech as ""a lot of words,"" the utility filed for bankruptcy protection. ??That afternoon, Davis called PG&E ""selfish"" and pointedly went into a negotiating session with John Bryson, the chairman and chief executive of Edison's parent Edison International. ??For Davis, the meeting was crucial. Although Edison had tentatively agreed in February to sell its transmission lines, the deal wasn't sewn up and Davis was nervous the PG&E bankruptcy would prompt Edison's creditors to ""jerk Edison into bankruptcy,"" Davis said last week. ??That afternoon, ""conceptually we reached an agreement,"" Davis said. The deal was announced the following Monday. ??Consumer advocates and some legislative leaders blasted the agreement as a giveaway, and said Davis hastily sweetened the terms for Edison because he needed to show progress on the energy crisis in the wake of the PG&E imbroglio. ??Not true, Davis said; the basic terms were already on the table before PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Either way, Edison was receptive to negotiating with Davis. ??Edison's background is different from PG&E's. Because it isn't in the natural gas business, it doesn't have the track record PG&E does with free markets. It is more comfortable in the regulatory and political realm, experts say. ??Notably, Bryson was president of the PUC in the 1970s - when Davis was Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of staff. ??""He knows Gray Davis,"" said ex-PUC President Wilk. ""He may feel a higher level of comfort in dealing with a very adversarial process. He felt he could rely on the governor."" ??Politically savvy, Edison is one of the utility industry's biggest contributors to national political campaigns, and it usually spends more than PG&E on California campaigns. Edison International's board of directors includes Los Angeles attorney Warren Christopher, the former U.S. secretary of state and an elder statesman of the Democratic Party. ??Though it's open to negotiations, Edison isn't a pussycat. To the contrary, experts say. ??""It was usually Edison that was more combative than PG&E,"" said Tom Willoughby, a retired PG&E lobbyist. ??Wilk agreed, adding: ""I find it curious that PG&E's being painted as the confrontational, aggressive company and Edison as the get-along, company."" ??Edison hasn't been shy about going to Sacramento for favors; last year, for example, Edison wanted some changes made in the operation of the state's power grid. Instead of talking to the grid manager, the Independent System Operator, Edison went to the Legislature, a source said. Lawmakers then pressured the ISO to make the changes. ??One more factor may have played into Edison's willingness to deal with the governor. ??Last year it became involved in a protracted dispute with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the transmission grid, over how much profit Edison could earn from the grid. ??Edison eventually won its point, but the case influenced the utility's thinking when Davis offered to buy the grid. According to industry consultant Barbara Barkovich, Edison figured, why wrestle with the federal government over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale? ??Besides, Edison has a back-up plan if the Legislature scraps the grid purchase, as many lawmakers have threatened. The company has said it would follow PG&E's lead and file for bankruptcy. ??But its willingness to negotiate with the governor will have served it well, even if it goes into bankruptcy, said Nancy Day, a utility industry veteran consulting for the Legislature. ??Day said she believes the governor's appointees on the PUC will ""punish"" PG&E for its behavior. If Edison winds up in bankruptcy court, it ""won't be punished for it,"" Day said. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch couldn't be reached for comment. ??Energy companies at a glance Edison Main subsidiary: Southern California Edison Headquarters: Rosemead, Los Angeles County Customers: 4.2 million in Southern California Chairman: John Bryson Performance: Lost $1.94 billion in 2000 on revenue of $11.72 billion Stock ticker symbol: EIX ??PG&E Main subsidiary: Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

BYLINE: Dan Walters BODY: ??No one knows for certain how - or when - California's energy crisis will conclude. It is an inordinately complicated four-dimensional chess game that has so far defied politicians' simplistic - perhaps simple-minded - efforts at resolution. ??That said, one may speculate reasonably on the financial, social and political consequences for California in the months and years ahead. ??Financially, Californians - especially the 70 percent who are served by private electric utilities - will feel the pinch for years, if not decades, to come. Before the crisis hit, California's power rates were already among the highest in the nation. Given the nearly $20 billion in power purchase debts that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far, the stubbornly high wholesale prices and other data, it's not unreasonable to project that Californians in private utility areas will see their rates double, or rise even higher. ??Politicians have been laying the rhetorical groundwork for big increases, although they've been disingenuous about the outer parameters. The burden will fall most heavily on business customers and, coupled with doubts about power reliability and rising natural gas prices, will damage the state's ability to attract job-creating investment. States with low and stable energy prices already are using the crisis as a recruiting tool. In February, Intel President Craig Barrett told the Wall Street Journal: ""As long as California is a Third World country, we won't build $2 billion manufacturing plants here."" ??The inevitable escalation of utility rates will create distortions within the state as well, since utility rates for the 30 percent of Californians served by publicly owned utilities are not likely to rise by more than token amounts. The municipal utilities' rates were roughly a third lower than private utilities' rates prior to the crisis. By the time the dust settles, they may be just half as much. It will contribute to the balkanization of California that was already being defined by such factors as housing prices, ethnicity and income levels. Low-cost regions will become magnets for people and jobs while high-price regions will be shunned. ??The energy crisis will certainly be the defining issue of the 2002 elections, and perhaps for others to follow. Gov. Gray Davis' popularity has plummeted since he took charge of the crisis, laying waste to his intentions to seek an easy re-election next year as a middle-of-the-road, business-friendly, tough-on-crime education reformer. ??With his popularity waning, Davis may be compelled to turn left, shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers and other liberal elements of the Democratic Party. That, in turn, would undermine the triangulating strategy he has pursued, in which he took Democratic voters for granted and cultivated business executives and social conservatives. Business interests are worried, for example, that Davis may now feel compelled to sign union-friendly legislation, such as boosts in workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, that he vetoed in the past. ??Davis' relations with fellow Democrats in the Legislature have turned from cool to poisonous, with lawmakers openly trashing his leadership and management of the energy crisis and worrying that he'll try to shift the blame to them if the crisis turns to disaster. If Democratic leaders fear that voters will be in a throw-the-bums-out mood next year, they may throttle back on intentions to maximize their party strength in drawing new legislative districts. Such maximization would require spreading Democratic voters out among many districts, and such margin-thinning could make Democrats vulnerable in an energy crisis-spawned voter rebellion. Democrats may well strive for fewer but safer seats. ??These are but a few of the potential effects that California will experience long after the immediate crisis has faded, whenever that may be. ??* * * ??The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com.

The energy ""crisis"" is good for us. ???For decades, we burned lights whenever we wanted, bought more and more energy-guzzling appliances, bigger and bigger television sets. Today, as citizens of the richest state in the world's only superpower, who is going to tell us when to stop? ???""We talk about having to hit mules over the head with a 2 by 4 to get their attention, but I don't think human beings are much more responsive or foresighted. I hate to see people suffering, but on the other hand, if that is the way we learn, so be it,"" says Ernest Callenbach, the Berkeley author of the futuristic 1975 novel, ""Ecotopia."" Callenbach's work was a major influence on the alternative energy policies of former Gov. Jerry Brown. ???Nowhere has the ethic of unlimited consumption been more out of control than in the Bay Area, where the energy demands of high tech outstripped what the electricity grid could supply. Aside from the energy needs of the industry itself, the wealth it generated encouraged avaricious lifestyles that include power-swilling mansions and freeways clogged with monster sport utility vehicles. ???Perhaps the 34 days of blackouts some experts predict for this summer will bring the discipline that eludes us. Except for the hardships the crisis has inflicted on the poor, Californians still enjoy a sybaritic lifestyle that, in ways, would put to shame the pharaohs of Egypt or the court of Louis XIV. Lights still burn when they're not needed. Except for very occasional blackouts, electricity still flows 24 hours a day. Our daily routines have barely been affected. A visitor from another state or country would have a hard time finding signs of our highly publicized ""crisis."" ???As we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the state Public Utilities Commission, imagine what life was like for Native Americans who lived for millennia in a bounteous Bay Area without microwaves, waffle irons, air conditioning or 24-cubic-foot refrigerators. No one is suggesting that we revert to those days. But let's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the piles of appliances whose tangle of cords clogs our homes and offices. ???Smug Californians love to point to the state's ranking as a miserly consumer of energy -- only three other states consume less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become greedy energy hogs. Tougher efficiency standards have helped, but so has our great weather. ""California has a uniquely good climate to be efficient,"" says Dan Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. ""Compared to countries with much harsher climates, we have not done enough."" ???There's no denying the sudden, sharp pain caused by the crisis -- from threats of sky-high electric bills to fears that California's economic engine is near collapse. But if we handle it right, all kinds of positive energy will result. Potential benefits extend from the spiritual (a revival of the conservation ethic) to the curative (making the state immune to power-problem overloads) to the liberating (throwing off for good our dependence on the Texas energy overlords). ???Consumers, shocked into action by tripled or quadrupled energy bills, are already rushing to Bay Area hardware stores, snapping up setback thermostats, hot water heater blankets, insulating window film and outdoor clotheslines. Alan Ginsberg of Satco Products in Hayward, who imports from China container-loads of squiggly shaped energy-saving fluorescent bulbs, says, ""They're flying out the door."" ???More significantly, the crisis impels the state to move ahead with the construction of badly needed power plants. It puts on the agenda of public debate the fundamental question of whether our energy system should be in the hands of giant utilities or run by municipalities or by the state. It certainly unveiled the greed of out-of-state energy producers who have sucked billions of dollars from California. ???The crisis has also made us focus on fundamental flaws in our energy grid, such as the 4,500-megawatt electricity shortage that emerged in the 1990s while we were all reveling in California's boom times. ???By exposing those who got us into this predicament -- producers, utilities, regulators and politicians -- there's a chance we'll get out of it with a more rational and efficient energy grid and be better prepared to deal with challenges down the road. If that happens, Gov. Gray Davis might yet confound critics who say his political prospects are sinking faster than you can say ""megawatt."" ???The ease and convenience of modern life fools us into thinking that power, water and food are infinite. Flip a switch and the lights magically go on. Turn a faucet and water flows. These days, the biggest challenge in gathering our daily bread is the hunt for a space in the supermarket parking lot. ???And we want it all, leading us straight into denial. We want instant, abundant power -- but we don't want any new power plants, especially in our backyards. Coal is dirty. Natural gas is expensive. Dams kill salmon. Nuclear power? Forget about it. The contradictions haven't mattered -- so long as an endless supply of electrons flowed from our wall outlets. But that mindless ease, the crisis taught us, is history. ???The energy crisis warns us that we must become more self-sufficient or risk slipping toward oblivion if we continue to spend billions of dollars on shrinking non-renewable energy sources such as coal and natural gas. ???The Roman Empire fell because of the decadence of its ruling elites. And the British empire, dependent on raw materials from the colonies, began to collapse when it became too expensive to import goods across oceans. ???A new consciousness about where electricity comes from is the first step toward using less of it. It could also translate into a greater awareness of other environmental causes. ???If we get the message, ""the net outcome (of the energy crisis) will be a quite profound shift in consciousness in energy conservation,"" predicts Michael Lerner, executive director of Commonweal, a health and environmental institute in Bolinas. ???Such a turnaround is no snap. ???During the last energy crisis in the 1970s, there was a similar rush toward conservation. President Jimmy Carter installed solar panels on the White House roof. President Ronald Reagan took them down. He also phased out tax credits and other inducements to encourage development of renewable energy sources. ???Closer to home, one of former Gov. George Deukmejian's first acts was to abolish the Office of Appropriate Technology established by Gov. Jerry Brown to move us away from our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. ???Since then, we have regressed further. Even record high gasoline prices have done nothing to depress the sales of SUVs, which now account for the largest share of automobile and light truck sales (20 percent at last count). ???But today's crisis could lead to permanent changes in behavior, if only because the technology needed to harness sun, wind and other renewable energy sources has become far more cost effective than a generation ago. California already gets 12 percent of its energy from these ""alternative"" sources, and the market incentives to develop them further has never been higher. ???Stratospherically high electricity bills could finally force on us the technological changes and the discipline that Europeans -- who use two-thirds as much energy per capita as we do -- and the Japanese -- who use only half as much -- have had to embrace. ???This difficult moment in California's history has already yielded some ecological epiphanies, like those experienced by Ernest Callenbach's neighbors. They installed solar photovoltaic cells on their roof. The installation now puts surplus electricity back into the energy grid, instead of sucking more out of it. ???""The magical moment is the idea that by having a photovoltaic cell on your roof, you can make your electric meter run backward,"" said Callenbach. ""Instead of it going to the right, you actually see it going in the other direction. You say to yourself, 'Oh Lord, Oh Lord, I have seen the future.'

B09 LENGTH: 704 words HEADLINE: Reality is what's needed for real policy GOVERNOR: Consumers deserve to get real facts from Davis. BYLINE: Dan Walters BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that he's on top of the state's energy crisis and, as he said at one gathering last week, ""in three years this problem will be a distant memory."" Fat chance. All major aspects of the situation are growing worse, not better, minute-by-minute. ??Politicians took over the crisis in January as the state's major utilities exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit. Davis began what he said then would be a short-term, emergency program of power purchases to keep electrons flowing into homes and businesses. ??From that moment forward, the situation has steadily deteriorated, moving toward a three-pronged disaster: severe summer blackouts, the bankruptcy of the utilities and sharply escalating power bills. With the bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and decisions by Davis and the Public Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates, two of the three negative scenarios are now in place. And everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindle. ??The Davis strategy, if there is one, is to continue the state's massive power purchases while negotiating longer-term and presumably cheaper supply contracts, encourage conservation, help utilities pay off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers, and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch. ??Currently, the governor is touting his deal with Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison, to sell its portion of the grid and is working on a similar deal with Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas and Electric. But PG&E's bankruptcy casts doubt on the viability of the cash-for-grid concept and legislators, particularly Davis' fellow Democrats, are very skeptical of the Edison deal. ??Clearly, Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PG&E filed bankruptcy, in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latter action, but its provisions are being labeled a ""bailout"" by critics. It places only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing the profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts. ??Meanwhile, the state is spending -- by Davis' own account -- about $70 million a day or $2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases, paying roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level. And the current futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jump by another 50 percent by mid-summer; higher prices and greater purchases could increase the drain on the state treasury to as much as $5 billion a month. ??State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a ""bridge loan"" to relieve pressure on the state's rapidly vanishing reserves, but Wall Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of what's happening and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature. ??He said Tuesday that Davis, who has maintained secrecy on power purchases, must offer a comprehensive and public plan for dealing with the financial squeeze. ??Meanwhile, bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities. ??Davis, for some reason, is unwilling to declare this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts shut down air conditioners, respirators and traffic lights. He insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances that things will turn out all right, even declaring to reporters this past Tuesday that ""we think we'll have this thing licked by the end of fall."" ??It's time for someone -- the governor, preferably, but someone -- to lay out for Californians exactly what's happening, the downside financial and power supply risks, and what's being done to deal with the looming disaster facing this state. ??It's time for politicians to treat us as adults who can face reality, not as children to be fed sugarcoated sound bites and slogans. ??-- Dan Walters writes for the Sacramento Bee.

BYLINE: NANCY VOGEL and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Two top state energy officials said Friday that a federal plan to stabilize electricity prices in California could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is illegal. ??In a barrage of complaints attacking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the state's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing California's transmission grid said they might challenge the federal order in court. ??The order was approved on a 2-1 vote Wednesday and released to the public late Thursday. ??""We're going to take whatever actions we can to oppose this to the extent our lawyers tell us it's illegal,"" said Michael Kahn, an attorney named by Gov. Gray Davis to head the board overseeing the California Independent System Operator. Cal-ISO manages the transmission grid reaching three-quarters of the state. ??In a conference call with reporters, Kahn and Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said the order also seems to indicate that FERC is unwilling to force power sellers to rebate any of the extraordinary profits earned before last October in California's market, where wholesale electricity prices began soaring last May. ??And, according to Kahn, the federal order illegally ties limits on power prices to a requirement that California link its transmission grid with those of other states. ??""It's not within their authority to have this kind of linkage,"" he said. ??The federal order is scheduled to take effect May 29. Though it is not clear how the order will play out in the state's electricity market, Lynch and Kahn said they do not believe it will bring down power costs or help the state avoid blackouts, as intended. ??""They're creating a whole new, wholesale blackout system,"" said Lynch, referring to a section of the order that allows large customers, such as steel mills and food processors, to get paid to shut down when grid operators are struggling to find enough electricity to meet demand. ??Though a somewhat similar program has helped California avoid blackouts, the federal order requires state power buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they shut down customers. ??The requirement of naming a price could lead to more blackouts, said Stanford University economist Frank Wolak, because it prevents power buyers from paying more if that's what it takes to keep electricity flowing. ??""Stating your price and sticking to it means that somebody could call your bluff,"" Wolak said. ""The generators just say, look, we can't supply all you want at the price you want to pay. ??""So they supply everything they can at the price we're willing to pay--and no more--and we have rotating blackouts,"" he said. ??Lynch said that no matter how this aspect of the FERC order unfolds, ""it ain't for Washington bureaucrats to decide when the lights go out in California. "" ??Grid operators at Cal-ISO must quickly buy batches of electricity to constantly match supply and demand on the transmission system serving most of the state, excluding the city of Los Angeles. When Cal-ISO cannot find enough power, it must order Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric to trigger rotating blackouts. ??The state suffered such controlled outages on four days in January and March, and many such days are predicted for this summer as air conditioning drives up demand for power. ??In other energy news Friday, Gov. Gray Davis announced in Los Angeles that electricity use in California state office buildings dropped by an average of 20% in the first two months of this year, compared to the same months of 2000. State workers have been under orders since late last year to turn off nonessential lights, computers, printers and other electrical appliances. Some agencies have even changed workers' schedules, eliminating ""flextime"" so that everyone works the same hours and the offices can open later and close earlier, shortening the energy-using day. ??* ??Times staff writer Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

BACKERS SAY PLAN WOULD BOOST SUPPLY, BUT FOES SEE IT COSTING CALIFORNIA DEARLY. BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??A Texas congressman plans to introduce legislation next week that would allow California's small power producers to sell their supplies on the wholesale market--a move that could threaten Gov. Gray Davis' plan to end the state's energy crisis. ??The proposal by Republican Rep. Joe Barton, the influential chairman of the House energy and air quality subcommittee, would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state's two biggest investor-owned utilities and sell their supplies to a third party. ??Proponents say the bill could dramatically bolster the state's electricity supplies by luring producers whose plants have been shut down by payment disputes to restart them in time for summer, when supplies are expected to be tight and blackouts are feared. ??But allowing producers to sell to a third party would essentially devastate Davis' plan to rescue the utilities and get the state out of the business of making emergency electricity purchases. ??The governor's plan is based on California locking down the costs of electricity from the utilities and small power producers for several years, at a reduced cost. ??During that time, the state would buy the remaining portion of the electricity the utilities need to serve their customers. Meanwhile, the utilities would regain their financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for being allowed to recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on electricity bills. ??If the alternative producers were allowed to sell their power on the wholesale market, the state could be forced to purchase much more electricity on the expensive open market. ??That would dramatically increase California's already massive power costs, forcing the state to further raise electricity rates and borrow even more than the record $ 12 billion in bonds it is planning to finance the plan. The state has spent more than $ 5 billion buying electricity that the utilities cannot afford, and Davis expects to spend $ 15 billion by year's end. ??""It is a way of busting the budget for the state of California,"" said Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street energy consultant hired by the Davis administration. He called the potential release of the small producers a ""disaster scenario"" for the state. ??Added Stephen E. Frank, chairman, president and chief executive of Southern California Edison: ""Releasing them from their contractual obligations will simply exacerbate the problem, because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state's problems."" ??But Eugene Peters of the Electric Power Supply Assn. disputed that contention. The state, he said, is already buying replacement supplies on the open market because of reduced output by small producers. ??""If 3,000 megawatts are made available again, it will have a potentially profound effect on what people pay for power by bolstering overall electricity supplies,"" Peters said. ??Utility executives contend that only 1,200 megawatts are offline because of payment problems. ??California is home to nearly 700 small energy producers, which generate more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in the state. They differ from their big out-of-state counterparts, which have been getting paid by the state. ??The Barton proposal will be the subject of public hearings Tuesday and Thursday, and could move to the full House Energy and Commerce Committee for a vote the next week. Barton could not be reached for comment Friday. ??The alternative-energy provision is one of several in his emergency energy bill. Others designed to help the West through a difficult summer of price spikes and energy shortages range from offering federal aid to relieving a bottleneck in the transmission system to permitting governors to secure waivers from environmental rules to boost power supplies. ??The provisions dealing with waivers of environmental rules have been among the most controversial, drawing opposition from environmentalists. ??* ??Times staff writer Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story.

The PUC told Edison and SDG&E to begin listing on electricity bills by June 1 the ""outage block"" into which each customer falls. ?The utilities then must use their Web sites to tell customers which blocks are slated for blackouts should more rotating outages be required. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. already lists outage block numbers on its customer bills. A pop-up box on PG&E's Web site shows which blocks are next in line for blackouts. Edison and SDG&E said they have been working on implementing such notification on their own and will comply with the PUC ruling.

A3; POWER CRUNCH LENGTH: 1109 words HEADLINE: Cities take new look at public power The state's uncertain electricity picture has local officials deciding it's time to revisit the idea of municipal utilities. BYLINE: Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer BODY: ??From the shipwreck of California's electric industry, Albert Vera sees a chance to build a life raft. ??""This is an opportunity that shall never come again,"" the former Culver City mayor told city and county officials gathered this week in Sacramento. ??Every rate hike, every blackout, every corporate bonus is more evidence for believers that it's time for local government to get into the power business. They pin their hopes on municipal utility drives in San Francisco, Corona, San Diego County and beyond. ??Over the past few years, however, only a handful of cities have set up their own electric departments, and they are mostly limited entities that fall short of full-fledged utilities. More commonly, cities - including Davis, Lincoln and Culver City - have studied the idea and rejected it, at least temporarily. ??They all face the same question, said Santa Rosa City Manager Jeffrey Kolin: ??""Is the investment worth the risk? Most of us would say we don't know yet."" ??Kolin's city, like scores of others across the state, has decided it is time to study the issue anew, motivated by the prospect of soaring electric bills, repeated blackouts, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing. ??""All their citizens are screaming,"" said Yvonne Hunter, a lobbyist for the League of California Cities. ??The highest visibility fight will likely come in November, when San Franciscans go to the polls to decided whether to create their own utility in a city that houses PG&E's corporate headquarters. ??""We will take it very seriously,"" PG&E spokesman John Nelson said. ??Shortly after deregulation in 1996, several drives for ratepayer-owned utilities stumbled or stalled. An effort in the far north state to create a multicounty public power agency was rejected by state regulators because some local governments objected. ??Now, with a bill to create a state power authority moving through the Legislature, some believe the climate may be changing. ??""One of the things this crisis has proved is the value of local control,"" said Jerry Jordan, head of the California Municipal Utilities Association. ??Since January, the cities of Hercules in the Bay Area and Corona in Southern California have formed utilities to deliver electric service to new neighborhoods - a strategy that sidesteps potential condemnation fights with the existing utility. The county of San Diego is trying to get special legislative authority to create a regional power agency without a popular vote. ??""We could produce power better, cheaper and faster than the private sector,"" county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said. ??Not so, say PG&E and Southern California Edison. ??""There's been much more talk of it, but as soon as most folks sit down and take a look at the realities ... they realize that they would have to buy on the same market, at the same outrageous prices that we and the state have been paying,"" Nelson said. ""The talk quickly evaporates."" ??For-profit utilities have long argued that government shouldn't usurp the role of private industry in delivering electricity. PG&E contends that the factors that once made public power attractive - such as access to low-cost electricity from federal dams - have evaporated. ??In addition, cities that try to withdraw from PG&E or Edison now probably would still have to funnel money their way for years to come, to pay off still-unsold state bonds that will stretch out a single year's power costs for up to 15 years. ??With so many unknowns, the next few years are likelier to produce more studies than new utilities, said a number of city officials who attended a seminar in Sacramento this week, sponsored in part by the American Public Power Association. ??Former New York state Sen. Al Coppola told the group the session should have been titled: ""Independence from the greedy robber baron utilities."" ??Public power backers share three key beliefs: ??* They can charge customers less because they don't have to pay dividends to investors or pay taxes on their sales; they can respond to local preferences on issues like which customers pay the lowest rates and how blackouts are staged; and existing utilities will do everything in their power to oppose them. ??""Edison did the right thing - (use) fear,"" to discourage Culver City from creating an electric arm in 1995, Vera, the city's former mayor, told the group. ??And Glenn Prentice, head of the newly created Corona electric utility, said in an interview that a half-dozen other cities have contacted him for more information, but he declined to name them. ??""If I do, Edison will start the attack on them. We're talking about a lot of money,"" he said. ""We're here to serve the public. They're here to make money."" ??PG&E sees new utilities as ""competition for our business,"" and it has a policy of lobbying hard against them, Nelson said. ??Less than 18 months ago, it warned residents of the Placer County town of Lincoln that a city power enterprise would be costlier and less dependable than PG&E, and its officials labeled the effort a ""tax dodge."" ??But by January of this year, PG&E barely blinked when Hercules set up a utility to deliver power and telecommunications service in new neighborhoods. ??""We got more resistance from AT&T and PacBell,"" said Raj Pankhania, assistant to the city manager of Hercules. ??Pankhania has been researching utility drives across the state and has seen no groundswell for public power, although he believes it can bring cities added revenue and more local control. ??That could change this summer, Prentice said. ??""It really depends on how bad the blackouts are."" ??A blackout that left one city councilmember's daughter at a darkened school was part of what led the Riverside County city of Corona to vote April 4 to form its own electric arm, he said. Heavy industry became anxious, too. ??""They said to the city council, 'Do something!' "" Prentice said. ??Skipping detailed studies, Corona quickly decided to create a utility that will build small power plants, under 50 megawatts, to serve city operations and new neighborhoods in the city of 127,000 east of Disneyland. ??In time, said Hercules' Pankhania, cities like his could become the living laboratory for whichever system can deliver better service and lower rates. ??Hercules' plans calls for the older two-thirds of its homes and businesses to retain their PG&E service and the newest third to be served by the city utility. ??""The existing homeowner will definitely compare five to 10 years down the road,"" he said. ""Then let the people decide which way they want to go."" ??* * * ??The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2001",important

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 --- --- ----------------------- Price Controls Spark Deja Vu=20 Energy: The specter of Richard Nixon's actions 30 years ago hangs over=20 current debate on how to check the state's surging power costs.=20 By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be= =20 adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are= =20 bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills. ?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20 economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in= =20 dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la= st=20 two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20 railroads to energy. ?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20 controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe= rs=20 as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics= =20 who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters= =20 worse for consumers. ?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use= =20 temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20 prices. ?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20 widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing= =20 shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts. ?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke= t=20 had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20 electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh= t,=20 something had to be done. ?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20 controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20 state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste= in=20 (D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo= se=20 price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states. ?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith= =20 stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also= =20 argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating= =20 power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls. ?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe= =20 that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G= OP=20 co-sponsor of the legislation. ?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi= ch=20 regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20 price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the= =20 price of electricity to the cost of producing it. ?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20 proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly= =20 stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20 administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the= =20 record as adamantly opposing price caps. ?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20 maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet= ,=20 ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica= n=20 president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20 level: Richard M. Nixon. ?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try= =20 to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20 dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in= =20 some cases, endorse setting limits on prices. ?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,= =20 chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas= . ?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when= =20 prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20 commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home. ?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete= d=20 at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la= w,=20 either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor= p.=20 and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise= =20 steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later. ?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were= =20 once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have= =20 been deregulated. ?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll= ed=20 for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la= w=20 has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled= =20 utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan= t=20 price controls on electricity until the crisis eases. ?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon. ?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan ?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon= =20 put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said= =20 Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,= =20 which oversees most of the state's electricity grid. ?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20 really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20 prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.= =20 Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,= =20 but I don't think it's ideal."" ?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20 either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe= nt=20 controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly= =20 pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote. ?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private= =20 sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level= =20 White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro= ls. ?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak= e.=20 But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20 prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock= =20 value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation. ?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the= =20 gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting = it=20 float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t= he=20 base upon which today's global financial markets operate. ?????Others disagree. ?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20 worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for= =20 Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York. ?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved= =20 because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20 output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar= =20 anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20 controls were in place, Goldberg added. ?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a= =20 couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas= =20 lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga= n. ?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl= y=20 cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr= ee=20 market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20 artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more= =20 power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend. ?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20 certain items seem to be spiraling out of control. ?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems ?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s= =20 included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro= m=20 the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire= =20 proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal= =20 controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t= he=20 cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20 Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20 subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted. ?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi= ze=20 that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or= =20 other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high. ?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply= =20 and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori= o,=20 who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer= =20 group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye= rs=20 refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20 option for people when it comes to electricity."" ?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20 controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to= =20 other states. That ""actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20 California] by driving imports out of the state,"" the Bay Area Economic=20 Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies= ,=20 said in a report last week. ?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to= =20 keep enough electricity in the state. ?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the= =20 Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are= =20 ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20 controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the= ir=20 expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at ""just and= =20 reasonable"" prices set by the federal agency, he said. ?????That would ""send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th= e=20 state,"" Wolak said. ?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20 power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'= t=20 unlike a natural disaster in which ""normal public service is disrupted"" and= =20 short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said. ?????""Over time, market forces will work"" and controls shouldn't be need, h= e=20 said.

And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much= =20 air pollution as before California's energy crunch. ?????Not every Glendale resident is happy. ?????""You don't want anyone to get stuck with a rolling blackout, but we ge= t=20 struck with the pollution,"" Jerold Petrosian said as he and his family boug= ht=20 plants at a nursery across the street from the power plant. ""It is a tough= =20 decision."" ?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. ""Ther= e=20 is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20 their lights on,"" he said. ?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the= =20 risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old. ?????""There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei= ng=20 their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer,"" said Dr. Henry Gong,= =20 professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti= on. ?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9= 95=20 pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the= =20 old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said. ?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than= =20 doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the= =20 South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted= a=20 total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month= s=20 of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year. ?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale= =20 may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved= =20 state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20 around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,= =20 hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20 demand because they are inefficient and costly. ?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20 Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three= =20 cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision= =20 that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate= =20 hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will= =20 contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they= =20 will be forced to breathe. ?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th= e=20 900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20 pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of= =20 the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20 pollution-control devices that reduce emissions. ?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20 inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city= =20 pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city= =20 officials say, with more retrofitting. ?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20 estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20 future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi= le=20 asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions. ?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser= ve=20 50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,= =20 2002, or when the energy emergency ends. ?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD= =20 caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four= =20 power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not= =20 produce any more nitrogen oxide, which in sunlight and heat form ozone, sai= d=20 Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning. ?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said. ?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks. ?????""We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants= ,""=20 said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20 Defense Council. ?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,= =20 are ""a far superior solution to diesel generators,"" which produce 50 to 100= =20 times the emissions and would be turned on in businesses across the state i= f=20 energy is unavailable from other sources. ?????""We are trying to make sure the environment overall is made whole,"" sh= e=20 said. ?????Carl Zichella, regional staff director for the Sierra Club, said the= =20 generators should be run as a last resort. He also urged consumers to unplu= g=20 spare refrigerators and use energy-efficient light bulbs to reduce the=20 state's overall energy demand. ?????""The only thing that is going to work to offset air pollution is=20 efficiency,"" he said.

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 --- --- ---------- Power Plant Plan Worries Neighbors=20 Energy crisis: Regulators will decide next week whether to allow Huntington= =20 Beach facility to boost output. Noise and pollution are concerns.=20 By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with= =20 their two very different neighbors. They live steps from the Pacific Ocean= =20 but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES= =20 Corp. power plant. ?????But California's power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the=20 neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows. ?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to= =20 double the plant's operations by July, providing much-needed electricity bu= t=20 taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them. ?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in= =20 the wake of the power crisis using a ""fast track"" process that allows the= =20 projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20 completed. ?????""The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in= =20 ways we won't know about until 10 years from now,"" said Janette Mortimer, w= ho=20 lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes=20 closest to the plant. ?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20 There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume= s=20 of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem= s=20 never to go away. ?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the= =20 facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials= =20 said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran = it=20 at 30% of capacity. ?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a ""peaker""= =20 unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen= =20 often this summer. The ""peaker"" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20 engines--and sounds like it. ?????Currently, only two boilers are operating. ?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and= =20 the water they swim in. ?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t= he=20 state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to = be=20 studied. ?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of= =20 Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo= ng=20 with other factors, played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that = is=20 discharged miles offshore back toward the coast. ?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20 research won't be complete for some time. ?????""So much is uncertain,"" said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20 Dettloff. ""These are big, big things."" ?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20 disruption. ?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20 construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July. ?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope= n=20 their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and= =20 smells from the plants may make that impossible. ?????""It's going to be bad. There's no escape,"" said Bryan Visnoski. ?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4= 0=20 years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a= nd=20 surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor. ?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others= =20 have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall= =20 trees and trained vines past the windows. ?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis. ?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20 AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20 deregulation. ?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant= =20 since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck. ?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov. Gray Dav= is=20 signed an executive order allowing ""peaker plants"" to operate at extended= =20 hours. ""Peaker plants"" can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle= =20 large amounts of natural gas and are noisy. ?????Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou= d=20 jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport. ?????Whenever the peaker plant goes on, residents call the Air Quality=20 Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke. The=20 inspections have not detected any violations. ?????The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to=20 double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from 500 megawatts to 1,0= 00=20 megawatts. ?????The company's two 40-year-old units represent about 10% of the 5,000= =20 additional megawatts Davis has promised to meet an expected energy shortfal= l=20 this summer. ?????Despite the fast-tracking process, the company has vowed that it would= =20 safeguard against environmental damage and remedy any problems from plant= =20 operations. ?????If the plant is identified as drawing bacteria back to shore, AES woul= d=20 have to pay the costs deemed necessary to fix problems. ?????This is little consolation to residents, who would prefer a full=20 environmental review.

Gray Davis on energy issues=20 Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20 subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power= =20 plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20 Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther= n=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to= =20 rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20 bankruptcy.=20 Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20 Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20 electricity problems?=20 Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available= =20 and the other is the price of power.=20 In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,= =20 we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20 Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20 leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never= =20 change until we have more power than we need.=20 OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]= =20 price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20 In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly= =20 $7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be= =20 this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20 Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do= a=20 thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20 consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20 The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I= t=20 is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an= d=20 able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t= o=20 the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s= ay=20 to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.= =20 We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20 I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow= ns=20 committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the= y=20 could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr= om=20 the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive= ry=20 systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental= =20 property around all their hydro facilities.=20 Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin= g=20 in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20 Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power= =20 entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business= .=20 In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20 power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20 itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but= =20 do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there= by=20 reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless= =20 them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them= =20 ourselves.=20 Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market= =20 prices will come down dramatically.=20 Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem = in=20 20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be= =20 raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20 Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20 solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20 increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20 efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The= y=20 are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20 increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20 Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o= r=20 at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a= =20 blackout?=20 Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20 devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20 accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20 I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going = to=20 say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way = to=20 keep the lights on.=20 Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha= t=20 companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i= n=20 coming years?=20 Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to= =20 market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20 purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will= =20 probably be in less than two months.=20 Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio= n.=20 I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg= e=20 I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20 Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe= r=20 crisis. Is that right?=20 Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20 reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20 At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I= =20 think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i= s=20 reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th= at=20 I proposed.=20 Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay= =20 the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20 Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20 relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out = of=20 the general fund.=20 Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20 Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa= nt=20 to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20 disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological= =20 productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ= ia=20 growing.

""The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. ""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."" ""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said. An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith. Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution: 1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition. As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators. 2. Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed, but California's political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis. 3. Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth. 4. Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California; increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona, contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets. 5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets. 6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy. 7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants -- suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve. 8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability. Industry Executives' Response Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully, expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the changing environment: -- Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California's current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. -- National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation. -- Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them. -- Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring. -- Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort. Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz: -- Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk limits and communications are in place. -- Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures -- Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions. -- Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies -- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier. -- Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices. -- Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans. -- Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address employees' concerns with information about the company's future and theirs'. Industry/Regulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain: -- Simplify market design. -- Build a continuing role for regulators. -- Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests. -- Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions. -- Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition. -- Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development. -- Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.

The first warm spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10 degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000 megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or alternative energy suppliers are not operating. The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips -- such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at 78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site www.caiso.com. New Notification System: With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to keep current if rotating blackouts are issued. Navigation: Visit www.caiso.com Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to bottom of page and click on Notice Log The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one email address per newsroom. Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after hours. News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via telephone.

From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen 489 percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent jump in Chicago. ??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co. subsidiary, for an explanation. ??""The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to constraints on the pipeline and demand?"" Steinberg asked. ??""Yes,"" Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis, which led power plants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than the year before exacerbated the problem. ??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E's movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. ??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said federal regulators should impose price caps on California's wholesale electricity market. ??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for re-regulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing nothing to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration. ??""I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president,"" said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 715 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES; LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL. BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then get a rebate in the mail. ??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced by the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates. ??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis an ""urgency"" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor had previously fought for and defended. ??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value. ??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will ""expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs."" ??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the rebates last year, when he said Californians ""don't appreciate the fact that they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands."" ??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the car tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which Davis felt would have a greater impact. ??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002, when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have fallen permanently, with no more rebates. ??""The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial election cycle,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates. ??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of their license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year. ??""Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction of 67.5%,"" said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on July 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut. ??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current ""awkward system . . . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and then await a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to explain."" ??But as the California economy tightened, the state's budget surplus shrank and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy electricity, the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment to Davis. ??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year. ??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed. ??""It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,"" McClintock said Thursday. ""He didn't want it on his desk."" ??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it as the lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) was substituted. ??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis' performance on the issue in an ""earlier time and a more just society"" would have resulted in his ""public flogging by representatives of taxpayers."" ??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent to Davis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday. ??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in order to take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because motorists must be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due. ??""We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail them by May 1 for the July 1 expiration,"" he said. ""It will be a little tight, but we will still make it."" ??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates, checks totaling $ 454 million have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra administrative cost of $ 9.4 million.

S. MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS. BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. ??""This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,"" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport. ??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market. ??""This is not a free-enterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite."" ??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting ""market power"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state. ??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state. ??""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong."" ??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering. ??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance. ??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices. ??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it. ??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices. ??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis. ??""We're not withholding capacity--no one is,"" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every molecule."" ??In other developments Thursday: ??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal ""would be a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said. ??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome. ??But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form. ??""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate."" ??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars. ??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply. ??""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,"" Wood said. ??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said. ??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs. ??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts. ??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer. ??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries. ??""It's not a huge amount,"" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, ""but every little bit helps."" ??* ??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. ??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. ??But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. ??""I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,"" Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. "" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing."" ??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. ??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,"" Massey said. ??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. ??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. ??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. ??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. ??""We're close because summer is approaching,"" Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. ??""It's important to me that we address the summer,"" Breathitt said, but said she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday. ??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be ""better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency."" ??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. ??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene ""is putting the whole grid at risk,"" said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. ""We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close."" ??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. ??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. ??""The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,"" Feinstein said. ""What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic."" ??But once again, timing could be a problem. ??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. ??""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" Feinstein said. ""Please please please, President Bush, process your nominees."" ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K512 LENGTH: 696 words HEADLINE: In response to power woes, rating agencies have California on credit watch BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. ??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could spell broader risk for the state's budget. ??The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. ??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March, to $73 million a day. ??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. ??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. ??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. ??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. ??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be spent. ??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for it. ??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ??""With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization,"" Cohen said. ""It signals to me that it could delay the financing process."" ??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected. ??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ??""It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high tech area,"" Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. ??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. ??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon. ??""It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does remain very strong,"" he said. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K520 LENGTH: 1069 words HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. ??Now, much of that is up in the air. ??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. ??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into bankruptcy court. ??""Little details are moving billions of dollars around,"" said Nettie Hoge of consumer advocate group TURN. ??All the proposals assume a ""tiered"" structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. ??Among them: ??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a 3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue $4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. ??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. ??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. ??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take effect immediately. ??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. ??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state. ??Each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates for ""medium"" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ""heavy"" use over 200 percent of that level. ??But that's where the similarities end. ??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. ??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? ??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. ??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's web site. ??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. ??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of just 7.5 percent. ??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. ??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate hike of nearly 30 percent. ??""The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. ??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. ??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. ??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ??""It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,"" Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. ??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. ??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. ??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ????????????????????APRIL 20, 2001, FRIDAY, FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. ???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. ???""We are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.

""This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."" ???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. ???""This is a very good deal for the state,"" he said. ""It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible."" ???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. ???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. ???""It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""Edison gets off scot-free."" ???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. ???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. ???""The deal on the table is still salvageable,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.

The previous administration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the president said, 'I'm focused on getting the job done,""' Rove said Wednesday in an Associated Press interview. ??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton, but the style has its critics. ??Some lawmakers, including members of his own party, said Bush could have saved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more lawmakers. ??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in Cincinnati, but ran the risk of looking detached. ??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House about Bush attending the U.S. crew's homecoming to reap the public relations reward for freeing the crew. ??But the president vetoed the idea, according to Rove, who quoted Bush as saying, ""I want it to be about them and I don't want to go through the discombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to show up."" ??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots, a budget battle or an international crisis, but Rove said, ""We intended to have a smaller profile than the previous administration."" ??Bush's ""attitude is that he's not going to be measured by whether or not he gets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress,"" Rove said during the 45-minute interview. ??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office, his hands folded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a Starbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were propped against a chair, still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White House. ??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall, allowing Bush's political strategist of eight years to ""go on vacation whenever I'm on the phone."" ??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the White House legislative agenda, maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and position the president for a re-election bid in 2004. ??Bush narrowly won the White House without California's 54 electoral votes, and Rove said the president could win re-election without the state ""but it's always nicer to carry the Golden State."" ??He said the state's electricity shortage will not hurt Bush's chances in 2004, adding that the administration has done ""virtually everything"" Gov. Gray Davis has requested. ??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough power plants and failing to follow the lead of other states, such as Bush's Texas, to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck. ??""This has got a very human dimension to it,"" Rove said. ""It's one thing to talk about power supplies. It's another thing when you talk about how it affects their jobs, how it's affecting their livelihoods, how it's affecting the safety of their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue and it ought to be a wake up call for the entire country."" ??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on recommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and natural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems, focusing on producing more domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants. ??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures aimed at helping California ease its shortages. ??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from politically competitive states to the White House, where they discuss their districts' needs and, often, gain local media attention. ??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign committees, helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which control of Congress is at stake. ??Rove also said: ??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime soon, allowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. ""You can only put so much into that pipe, and we've stuffed it,"" he said of Bush's crowded legislative agenda. The ""fast track"" authority is key to Bush's plans for a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the focus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City. ??-Americans will support Bush's environmental policies despite criticism of his decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton administration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for political troubles. ""I'm not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it's interesting"" that Clinton waited until the last moment to act. ??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be able to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress. ""We are not all one single labor market,"" Rove said.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For residential customers, a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16 percent. ??""This is not a final decision,"" said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP and Idaho Power. ""In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff."" ??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between Idaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, the staff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy electricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it. ??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP, repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to Idaho Power for a profit. ??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could financially cripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open market and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is increased. ??""The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems,"" Beaman said, ""and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well."" ??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees - a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company had achieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before. ??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request. ??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a commission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale electricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at unrealistic levels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates constantly. ??""We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and spirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers,"" Beaman said. ??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a case before them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. ??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended: ??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request, without interest, until answers are available about the company's electricity deals. ??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when the commissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part of the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases that the staff believes will be much more expensive next year. ??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it was an error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned on passing on to ratepayers. ??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation by Idaho Power customers. ??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is substantially over 20 percent. ??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings. ??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh used, 6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2,000 kwh, and 7.48 cents per kwh for use over 2,000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh. ??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task, saying it was warned of the possibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995. ??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during the past decade because with electricity deregulation looming, nobody knew what independent power facilities were being considered.

San Jose Mercury News April 19, 2001, Thursday KR-ACC-NO: SJ-POWER LENGTH: 593 words HEADLINE: Testimony Indicates California Electricity Market Was Troubled in 1998 BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey BODY: ??SACRAMENTO, Calif.--California's electricity market was showing signs of trouble as far back as 1998, the year that it was officially opened to competition, members of a special legislative investigating committee were told Wednesday. ??Abnormal price spikes -- far higher than what should have occurred in a competitive market -- were showing up in August 1998, the committee was told by Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist and top advisor to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid. ??Appearing on the first day of hearings called by a state Senate select committee to investigate alleged wholesale energy price manipulation, Wolak testified that the ISO's economic advisors repeatedly found signs that power suppliers were able to influence prices over the last three years -- even before wholesale prices soared skyhigh last summer. ??By controlling even a relatively small portion of power supply, just enough to make a difference in whether the state could meet consumers' needs, Wolak said, generators have been able to charge prices far higher than their costs. ??All told, the ISO has estimated, power suppliers collected more than $ 6 billion in unjustified profits last year. ??In his opinion, Wolak added, that violates the terms by which federal regulators allowed the suppliers to enter the state's newly deregulated market when it opened in 1998. ??The ISO is now filing petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, asking that agency to revoke the generators' right to charge unregulated prices. ??But Wolak repeatedly told the committee that he had no evidence that the suppliers acted in collusion or that they had violated any federal anti-trust laws. ??When state Senator Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, pressed him on the point, Wolak insisted, ""I can't say yes, I can't say no. There's a lot of things that certainly look puzzling. It's hard without further information and analysis to say definitively, but there's lots of things to seem to be worth looking into."" ??Dunn, a former consumer attorney, is leading the Legislature's efforts to answer a question that a host of other state and federal officials have also posed: have California's electricity prices been the result of any illegal or unethical acts? ??Power suppliers and their representatives have repeatedly said the answer is no. They say their prices are the result of short supplies and natural market swings. ??""Eleven investigations into California's electricity market have been conducted or are currently under way,"" said a statement issued Wednesday by Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. ""Not one has found or proven any wrongdoing by generators."" ??Dunn, however, said Wednesday's testimony was only the start of what he promised would be a vigorous investigation. He said the committee has already asked several power companies for records and other information and he hinted that subpoenas may be issued in the coming weeks. ??""We will try to figure out how to stop these high prices if they are unjustified,"" Dunn said at the beginning of the hearing. ??""We're not going to be looking for ways to finance these payments,"" he added. The state is now paying $ 70 million a day to buy power for California consumers, after major utilities wracked up billions in debts while buying power on the open market in recent months. ??----- ??To see more of the San Jose Mercury News, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sjmercury.com JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 5 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ??????????????????????April 19, 2001, Thursday, BC cycle AM Eastern Time SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 930 words HEADLINE: Developments in California's energy crisis BYLINE: By The Associated Press BODY: ??Developments in California's energy crisis: ??THURSDAY: ??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??- Gov. Gray Davis meets with 25 members of the California congressional delegation at the Los Angeles International Airport to discuss the state's power crisis. ??- An Assembly committee continues hearings on the natural gas supply and possible price manipulation. ??-The Public Utilities Commission meets in San Francisco to decide whether to investigate if a key bloc of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants offline. ??WEDNESDAY: ??- Unchecked free-market forces drove up the price of natural gas to Southern California Edison by about $750 million over the last year, an industry consultant tells the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee. ??Meanwhile, the Senate's Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market begins investigating whether electric generators artificially inflated power prices. ??An industry spokesman predicts the investigations will uncover nothing illegal. ??- The state offers financial backing to Houston-based Dynegy, which worried it would not be paid for power generated at its plants in California. Dynegy agrees to sell 300 megawatts of power from 17 small turbine generators in Carlsbad after receiving an offer from the California Department of Water Resources. ??- Gov. Gray Davis urges state regulators to approve the construction of a controversial 600-megawatt power plant in south San Jose to provide electricity to roughly 450,000 homes in the Silicon Valley. ??- The Democratic governor lobbies Senate Democrats to support his plan to pay $2.7 billion for the transmission lines owned by Southern California Edison. ??State spending on electricity has jumped by more than 50 percent since Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. declared bankruptcy April 6, thanks in part of surcharges tacked on by power generators worried they won't be repaid, Davis said. ??- The Senate Appropriations Committee sends the full Senate a bill creating a public power authority that would loan out up to $5 billion to build or buy power plants that would be required to sell electricity to consumers at low rates. ??- An Assembly committee advances a bill ending the exemption under which utility lobbyists do not have to follow the same reporting requirements as do other lobbyists. The bill now goes to the Assembly Appropriations Committee. ??- A Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. shareholder sues the company, claiming it misled shareholders by forecasting annual profits for two quarters last year when, the suit says, the company knew it was incurring losses. ??-Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch issues a statement late Wednesday, saying inaction by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forced Southern Caifornia Edison Co. to take a large write-off of debt. ""The company should not have to shoulder these liabilities and neither should its customers,"" Lynch says. ??- Edison International's stock closes at $11.40, down 48 cents, while stock in PG&E's parent closes up 14 cents at $9.04. ??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- The Assembly's Energy Oversight Subcommittee plans to resume hearings Thursday in its inquiry into California's highest-in-the-nation natural gas prices with testimony from gas companies. ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??- The state Public Utilities Commission will decide Thursday whether to investigate why a key block of power generators is staying off-line despite regulators' order last month that they start getting paid by the state's utilities. Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones says the generators can't afford to operate because they are still owed more than a billion dollars, and because the PUC's rates don't cover their operating costs. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch also wants the commission to decide Thursday to investigate whether PG&E's April 6 bankruptcy protection filing is enough of a threat to the PUC's regulatory authority to prompt more PUC involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying.

""It's obviously way higher than $100 million."" ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said. ??""I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world,"" said Carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge, Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??Officials with El Paso and other natural gas suppliers have denied illegally manipulating the market. They are scheduled to testify Thursday. El Paso officials did not return telephone calls for comment Wednesday. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??""This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power,"" Frank Wolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However, ""there is no law against me saying, 'I'm not going to sell to you,""' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion, Wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??""Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem,"" said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations ""are wasting everybody's time,"" Smutny-Jones said, adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??""People have been playing by the rules,"" Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, federal, academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns, Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??""If the state's offering a $50 million reward, they haven't found anything,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here."" ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: ""I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on."" ??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??""There clearly are market forces at work, that's evident,"" Campbell said.

Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??- The state Public Utilities Commission will decide Thursday whether to investigate why a key block of power generators is staying off-line despite regulators' order last month that they start getting paid by the state's utilities. Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones says the generators can't afford to operate because they are still owed more than a billion dollars, and because the PUC's rates don't cover their operating costs. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch also wants the commission to decide Thursday to investigate whether PG&E's April 6 bankruptcy protection filing is enough of a threat to the PUC's regulatory authority to prompt more PUC involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying. LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 Power bloc blasts seizure idea Producers say talk of bold action fuels crisis By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU ?-- Oakland Tribune SACRAMENTO -- Outraged by a report in The Oakland Tribune that some lawmakers asked the governor to seize high-priced power contracts, a key industry group Tuesday warned the Davis administration and Legislature that such action would worsen the energy crisis. ""We're publicly saying . . . this kind of rhetoric will have dire consequences on both the reliability and cost of power in California for years to come,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. ""It is the kind of rhetoric one would expect in Indonesia or the Philippines, not the sixth largest economy on the planet,"" he said in a teleconference. At the same time, Davis administration officials confirmed that seizing contracts of allegedly profiteering brokers is the most likely last-ditch move if options continue to narrow, ahead of the previously discussed concepts of seizing California power plants owned by out-of-state firms or passing a windfall profits tax. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio pointed out the governor already seized power contracts on which California's investor-owned utilities were defaulting in early February. The state, trying to buy its way out of the energy crisis with no clear end in sight, lost a substantial measure of control over electricity prices and supplies to the courts with the recent bankruptcy filing by the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, employed hard-sell tactics Tuesday in an effort to convince reluctant Democrats that their failure to embrace his plan to financially rescue teetering Southern California Edison could plunge that utility into bankruptcy, as well. While most Republicans are flatly opposed to the plan as misguided, Democrats, who hold a majority in the Legislature, worry it's a public bailout of an investor-owned utility and would hand the state control over only Edison's south-state piece of the strategic high-voltage transmission grid in California. Soaring wholesale power costs have financially shattered utilities, forcing the state into runaway, multibillion-dollar spending that helps keep the lights on but threatens the state budget. The manager of the state's power grid has accused generators and marketers of overcharging Californians more than $6 billion in recent months. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Monday that members of both legislative houses were interested in seizure of California power plants' contracts with brokers, who sell to customers within or outside the state. Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, an outspoken critic of the Davis administration's handling of the crisis, said some lawmakers had asked the governor to use emergency or eminent domain powers to seize the overpriced contracts and were awaiting Davis' answer this week. Supporters of the move said seizure would allow the state to control where the power is sold and decrease price markups by eliminating the middleman. But myriad questions remain unanswered, including regulatory and interstate commerce issues as well as any state reimbursement of the brokers. Any move to seize power contracts would be overturned by the courts, said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum. ""Instead of trying to do what's legally within their reach, they go to extreme measures that are on their very face unlawful and unconstitutional,"" Ackerman said. Moreover, industry officials said, seizure would not only chill industry investment in California's power system and lead to higher power costs but would be ironic since California has shunned lower-cost, long-term contracts, industry officials said. ""It would create a very unstable political, regulatory environment,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""It would have extremely adverse consequences for California in the long term."" Even so, the talk has worried the industry. Smutny-Jones said his clients are ""very, very troubled by this sudden turn in rhetoric."" ""I assume when senior members of the Legislature make pronouncements about potentially seizing contracts, it's designed to get our attention and we obviously take those things seriously,"" he said. The Independent Energy Producers group is ""in the process"" of contacting the Davis administration and lawmakers, said Smutny-Jones. ""You'll hear more about this."" Copyright 2001 Copley News Service Copley News Service April 19, 2001, Thursday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 780 words HEADLINE: Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backing BYLINE: Bill Ainsworth DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. ??The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. ??Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. ??Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. ??The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. ??El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. ??Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California ''simply unprecedented'' in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. ??In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, ''qualifying facilities'' that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. ??El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. ??In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. ??Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. ??''I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,'' Davis said. ??Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. ??The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. ??At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. ??''Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,'' said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. ??State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. ??But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. ??''The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,'' FERC ruled. ??In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. ??Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. ??''It baffles me that we've found the problem anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,'' said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.

Not going to happen, Vice President Dick Cheney insists. Don't waste your energy thinking about it. ??""Frankly, California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps,"" Cheney said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ??The vice president was referring to another type of price cap--the infamous state cap on consumer rates that has left the private utilities billions short of enough revenue to pay their gouging wholesalers. What political leaders in California and the Northwest are pleading for from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a regional cap on wholesale prices. ??Early last year, a megawatt-hour was selling wholesale in California for $ 30. By year's end, it had risen to an average $ 300, according to state officials. At peak, prices have soared to $ 1,500. Meanwhile, demand increased last year by less than 4%. In fact, demand last month was 9% less than in March 2000. ??This is the sorry news for ratepayers/ taxpayers: Californians paid $ 7.4 billion for electricity in 1999. This year, the tab--without price caps--is projected at $ 70 billion. Gov. Gray Davis disclosed Tuesday that his administration has been shelling out $ 73 million a day to buy electricity for the pauper utilities. ??The profits of power producers--many of them Texans and Bush backers--have risen 400%-500%-600%. ??* ??But none of this budges the Bush administration. ??Price caps, Cheney declares, may provide ""short-term political relief for the politicians. But they don't do anything to deal with the basic fundamental problem."" That problem is supply, he says; price caps discourage investment in new power plants and encourage consumption. ??Counters Garry South, Davis' political strategist: ""The notion by free market zanies that you have to let profits rise 500%-600% is ludicrous. Reasonable profits can be made without bankrupting the system. They're just trying to protect the profits of their friends in the energy business."" ??In truth, California is building power plants as fast as it can. But not enough new megawatts apparently will be online by summer to prevent blackouts--and the bleeding of billions more into the pockets of out-of-state profiteers. ??How about a temporary price cap? ??""Six months? Six years?"" Cheney replies. ""Once politicians can no longer resist the temptation to go with price caps, they usually are unable to ever muster the courage to end them . . . ??""I don't see that as a possibility . . . Any package you can wrap it in, any fancy rhetoric you can prop it up with, it does not solve the problem."" ??* ??The White House clearly understands it has a problem in California--a political problem. A problem with a Democratic-dominated state that voted overwhelmingly for Al Gore. And now a problem with that mythical headline--Bush to California: Drop Dead--which seems to be getting bigger each day. ??There have been several recent California: Drop Dead stories. One was in Sunday's New York Times--""Bush Devoting Scanty Attention to California."" Tuesday, the Sacramento Bee reported that when Cheney met with Northwest members of Congress to discuss West Coast energy, he barred Californians from the room. ??Cheney flatly denies it. ??But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has had trouble making contact with the Bush White House. She has sent two letters to President Bush asking for a meeting on energy. The first time, she got back a form letter with her name misspelled. On the second try, she got a group meeting with Cheney. ??""It was very disappointing,"" she says. ""He spoke about letting the free market work and drilling in Alaska . That's not going to help California in the short-term. We need price caps until we're able to fix this very broken market. . . ??""There seems no interest in really wanting to understand the California situation."" ??I asked Cheney whether he sensed an anti-California bias across the country? ""No more than there's an anti-Texas bias,"" he replied. ""I wouldn't get paranoid about it. ??""The fact is, California is one of the leading states in the nation. Often a trendsetter. . . . Well, we hope not to emulate your energy policy. Hopefully, we'll learn from that."" ??His message to California: ""There's no reason not to be optimistic. The energy crunch obviously is a significant problem. . . . But it too will pass."" ??While learning from California, the Bush White House also might take a refresher course in the free market Hoover administration.

BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN and TERENCE MONMANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Attempting to show that no region in California is safe from sacrifice, Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday called for quick state approval of a controversial power plant proposed for the Silicon Valley. ??The governor's action locks him in combat with the San Jose City Council, which has unanimously rejected the plant, and Cisco Systems, the computer networking giant that wants to build its worldwide headquarters on adjacent land. ??In praising the proposed plant as a model of low-polluting efficiency, Davis said all regions of California must share the pain as the state expands its power supply--a key step toward ending blackouts and reducing sky-high electricity prices. ??If approved, the plant would be the 14th licensed by the California Energy Commission since Davis took office. The 13th--a 510-megawatt plant near San Diego--was approved unanimously by the commission Wednesday with little controversy. ??Rushing to expand the state's overtaxed energy supply, the governor has recently cut in half the approval times for the licensing of some plants. Six are under construction, according to Davis, and three are scheduled to begin operation this summer. A fourth--the AES Corp. generator in Huntington Beach that is due to be restarted --could add more megawatts to the supply this summer. ??V. John White, an energy consultant in Sacramento, said the governor's newly active role as an advocate for power plants was a necessary step given the urgency of the supply shortage. ??""It's very rare, and I wouldn't want him to short-circuit the commission's review process,"" White said. ""But I think he's trying to reassure folks we're doing everything we can and not just sitting around in our hot tubs."" ??Davis urged the Energy Commission--a five-member panel dominated by his appointees--to stop talking about the project and grant it a license. If the commission does so, it will mark only the third time the panel has usurped a local government's authority over zoning. ??""We are all in this together,"" Davis said, flanked by a forest of electric transformers near the Capitol. ""We are one state, and we all have to make the sacrifices necessary to make up for the mistakes of the last 12 years, when no major power plants were built."" ??The governor said the plant's developers, Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Holdings Inc., have made ""numerous concessions"" to San Jose officials, including an agreement to sell power exclusively in the region. ??He added that the $ 300-million plant--expected to supply about 450,000 homes--will be equipped with state-of-the-art systems that make it ""one of the cleanest plants to go up in the nation."" ??The commission's staff has recommended licensing the project, and some analysts said the governor's intervention--said to be unprecedented--should fuel momentum for approval. ??Commissioner Robert Laurie--one of two members who held evidentiary hearings on the project and is preparing a recommendation for the full commission--would not comment on the plant's prospects. But Laurie, an appointee of former Gov. Pete Wilson, insisted that the project would receive an impartial review. ??""I know the importance of independent decision-making,"" he said. ??San Jose officials say the Calpine project conflicts with the aesthetics of its site in a bucolic valley 15 miles south of downtown. On Wednesday, Mayor Ron Gonzales urged the Energy Commission to ""give serious attention"" to the city's concerns about the plant's potential impact on residents and the environment. ??""As the project has been designed and proposed to operate . . . it would present an unfair burden to our community,"" the mayor said. ??A spokeswoman for the Calpine/Bechtel partnership disagreed and characterized the plant as key to restoring energy stability in the Silicon Valley, a region heavily dependent on imported power. ??""This is the only project in the pipeline that can help Silicon Valley out of its predicament in the near future,"" said the spokeswoman, Lisa Poelle. ??She expressed hope that the governor's comments, which cap numerous meetings between the partnership staff and Davis aides, would encourage San Jose to soften its stance on the project. ??The 600-megawatt plant is proposed for a swath of open space currently leased to a rancher and occupied by grazing cattle. A preliminary ruling by Laurie and the other commissioner scrutinizing the project is expected by June. The full commission would take a final vote about a month later, and if a license were granted, the plant would begin operations sometime in 2003. ??From the beginning, the plant has been dogged by opposition, and the Energy Commission has held more than 20 hearings--an unusually large number--on its fate. ??On Wednesday, a spokesman for its heftiest foe, San Jose-based Cisco, said the company still has serious concerns about ""health and safety issues."" ??Cisco has strongly opposed the plant because the company wants to build a $ 1.3-billion headquarters for 20,000 employees nearby. In the past, Cisco officials have threatened to relocate to another state if the power plant is built. ??Company spokesman Steve Langdon said the firm's plans to build an industrial campus were not scuttled by the announcement Monday that it is cutting 8,500 workers from its payroll because of slumping sales of its Internet networking equipment. ??But he suggested that the plans were flexible enough to be scaled down for a smaller work force and that the campus may not house the company's headquarters. ??""It doesn't all get built at once,"" he said. ""We will build and occupy the site over time in phases as needed."" ??Another leading opponent of the power plant argued Wednesday that the Energy Commission lacks authority to override San Jose officials and license the project. The Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group, launched by homeowners near the site, says the commission may only take such a step if a better plant site hasn't been identified. ??The group charges that the commission is aware of other available sites, including one in an industrial part of the East Bay area, and lists eight other reasons the plant should not be built, among them the noise and emissions it would produce. ??The local Sierra Club chapter, however, has endorsed the plant largely on grounds that it would run cleaner than existing plants in the area. By offsetting emissions from those older plants, the new project would actually reduce air pollution, said Kurt Newick of the Sierra Club's Loma Prieta chapter. ??On another front, Davis continued to lobby legislators for support for his plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy through purchase of the utility's transmission grid. ??Emerging from lunch with state Senate Democrats who are openly wary of the deal, Davis said he'd made progress to ""bridge some of the gaps."" It was the governor's third meeting in two days with lawmakers of both parties. ??Some of the toughest skeptics are members of his own party in the Senate. Many fear that the deal Davis struck with Edison will hand the utility too much at the expense of ratepayers, and some say bankruptcy might be a better option for the state's second-largest private utility. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy April 6. ??To assuage concerns, Davis proposed that a special Senate committee be named to meet with his energy advisors as the administration and Edison finalize details of the deal before it goes to the Legislature for approval. ??Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who has called the Edison agreement ""problematic,"" said he may appoint such a committee but continued to suggest that an Edison bankruptcy might be acceptable. ??""Many of the Fortune 100 companies have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and it ain't like the end of the world for anybody,"" Burton said. ??* ??Times staff writer Carl Ingram contributed to this story. ??Powering Up California ??Power plant projects recently licensed by the California Energy Commission and when they are expected to go online: ??* ??* Two of four turbines are expected to go online in December 2001; the other two are expected to go online in March 2002. ??Source: California Energy Commission GRAPHIC: PHOTO: (2 photos) Gov.

Consequently, its customers' power rates are expected to be stable this year while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers face huge rate increases. ???But municipal utilities such as Alameda's are still part of the statewide power grid, which is managed by the Independent System Operator, and are subject to rolling blackouts like everybody else when the state's energy reserves dip below 1.5 percent. ???Each of Alameda's four diesel generators will produce 1.5 megawatts of power. Each megawatt can light up 1,000 homes, utility officials say. ???The units, leased at a total cost of $68,000 a month through the end of the year, are parked at Alameda Point. ???Their cost will be paid through the municipal utility's reserve fund and customers' power bills won't be affected, said Junona Jonas, the utility's general manager. ???""I think in the long run, we'll see more supply in the state, but until that happens, there will be communities that'll have to take these short-term drastic measures,"" Jonas said. ???The utility's spokesman, Matthew McCabe, said the diesel exhaust from the generators won't be an environmental factor. ???""Our environmental record is extremely important to us,"" McCabe said. ""The diesel generators are only for emergency backup. . . . Besides, these things are clean -- it's not like standing next to a diesel bus."" ???The city is also getting help from the U.S. Maritime Administration, which operates more than a dozen ships at the former Navy station in Alameda. When the juice is low, those ships will unplug from the port and use onboard generators, Jonas said. ???In the North Bay, Healdsburg officials are waiting for the arrival of two diesel generators. Combined, they are expected to produce 3.5 megawatts of power, which can account for about 20 percent of the city's expected summer peak load, said Bill Duarte, city utility director. ???""We're taking matters into our own hands,"" he said. ???Farther south, both Santa Clara and Palo Alto are considering leasing portable generators, officials said. ???Bill Reichmann, senior electric utility engineer at Santa Clara's Silicon Valley Power, said the utility is planning to lease eight generators, operating them in the southeastern end of town near the San Jose International Airport. ???Palo Alto's municipal utility also has recommended that the City Council approve renting two generators starting next month, said spokeswoman Rima Johnson.E-mail Matthew Yi at myi@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis' assertion that the state is being gouged by power companies because of PG&E's bankruptcy filing. ???Such dissent from the governor's own subordinates could make it harder for Davis to gain support for his energy measures in the state Legislature. ???Despite Davis' latest claims, the Department of Water Resources, which is spending about $70 million a day buying power, said there is no evidence linking recent price increases to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. ???""It is a seller's market,"" said Viju Patel, executive manager of the Department of Water Resources' power systems department. ""The power companies do not need an excuse to raise prices."" ???Critics say Davis' penchant for secrecy on energy issues has come back to haunt him at a time when he needs all the allies he can find. ???""People aren't taking his words at face value,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ???Republican lawmakers -- and even some Democrats -- have challenged a number of the governor's initiatives, including a multibillion-dollar bailout scheme for Southern California Edison. ???Nevertheless, Davis reiterated his belief yesterday that recent electricity price increases are ""an aberration driven by the bankruptcy of PG&E."" ???He said California's spending on power jumped 40 percent in the week following PG&E's bankruptcy filing because generators say they face a greater risk of not being paid. ???""Nothing else in the equation has changed,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor. ""Everything is the same except the bankruptcy."" ???However, power companies were quick to challenge this assertion. They insisted that PG&E's bankruptcy actually was seen as a positive development by those in the energy business. ???""If anything, PG&E provides some solace for traders because the bankruptcy provides an organized mechanism for recovery of payments,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy-industry association. ???On the other hand, he acknowledged that power companies are becoming increasingly wary of the state of California's creditworthiness as an energy buyer. ???The Department of Water Resources already has spent nearly $5 billion buying electricity and has yet to recoup a dime from ratepayers. State regulators are still trying to come up with a way to apportion the limited revenues from power rates among the various parties in California's energy picture. ???Rating agency Fitch Inc. said yesterday it may cut the state's credit rating because of questions surrounding recovery of energy costs. ???""People are keeping an eye on things,"" Ackerman said. ""They're watching how California finances things."" ???If a premium on electricity sales to the state exists, he said it probably has been in place since the beginning of the year, well before PG&E's current woes. ???UCAN's Shames agreed. He said power companies added a ""risk premium"" to their California power sales late last year when it looked like the state's energy troubles were worsening. ???""PG&E's bankruptcy may have increased the uncertainty,"" Shames said, ""but we've been paying a risk premium for months now."" ???Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, insisted that his company's traders are not using questions about PG&E's or California's financial solvency as a fresh excuse for higher prices. ???""I haven't seen any evidence of it,"" he said. ???Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston's Enron Corp., laid blame for recent price increases on low rainfall throughout the West, which has cut output at hydroelectric facilities, as well as on California's chronic power shortage. ???""It's not that there's a premium on prices,"" he said. ""It's just supply and demand."" ???That said, Palmer acknowledged that California's firm insistance on blackouts being avoided at all costs leaves the state vulnerable to virtually any price generators choose to demand. ???""This means prices will be used to allocate a scarce resource,"" he said. ""There's no other way it could work."" ???Bottom line for consumers: It's going to be a long, hot summer, and electricity prices will soar even higher as demand surges. ???And despite the best efforts of state officials, a daily threat of blackouts remains a virtual certainty as California's beleaguered power grid is stretched to the breaking point. ???At the Department of Water Resources' command center in a Sacramento shopping mall, the state's team of electricity traders has moved onto a new, high-tech trading floor, where they negotiate power deals each day from the crack of dawn. ???The department's Patel said daily blackouts may be averted this summer after consumers see skyrocketing power prices reflected in their bills. ???""People will respond to these prices and they are going to conserve like never before,"" Patel predicted.E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis urged the state Energy Commission yesterday to approve a controversial power plant in San Jose, saying California needs every megawatt it can harness. ???Davis' recommendation runs counter to the wishes of the San Jose City Council and Mayor Ron Gonzales, who have come out against the 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in south San Jose's Coyote Valley. It also puts the governor at odds with one of his political allies, Cisco Systems chief John Chambers, whose company opposes the plant because it would be built near the tech firm's proposed new campus. ???Davis' announcement came the same day he all but admitted he lacks the support he needs in the state Senate for the deal he reached with Southern California Edison to restore the utility to financial health. Davis has portrayed that deal and construction of new power plants as essential to making California's energy market functional again. ???""I think when we have an opportunity to put more power on line we should seize it,"" Davis said. ""I believe we spend too much time talking about Metcalf. It's time to start building it."" ???The Energy Commission has been reviewing the proposal by Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Inc. for months. The commission's staff recommended in October that the plant be built, and a final decision is expected by summer. If it is approved, the plant could come on line next year and provide enough electricity for 600,000 homes. ???None of the five commissioners could be reached yesterday. Three are Democrats appointed by Davis and two are Republicans appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. ???Gonzales and the rest of the City Council rejected the Metcalf plant in November. Until yesterday, Davis had sat on the sidelines as the energy crisis deepened and a long line of state and federal officials, including four of the five Assembly members from Silicon Valley, urged the commission to overturn the council's vote. ???Some neighborhood groups oppose the plant, along with computer networking giant Cisco, which hopes to build a 20,000-worker campus on a neighboring parcel. Cisco chief Chambers donated $50,000 to Davis in the first six months of last year. ???Cisco's reaction yesterday was restrained. ???""We have great respect for the governor and respect his decision,"" said Cisco spokesman Steve Langdon. ???However, Langdon added: ""We still have serious concerns about health and safety issues related to the proposed power plant."" ???Some neighbors were much angrier. ???""He's trying to act like he's the big, bad tough governor, and he's spineless,"" said Issa Ajlouny, who lives in the Santa Teresa neighborhood, less than a mile from the proposed plant. ""He knows the approval process isn't working in his favor, so he's trying to come out and act like a hero to the state of California. But he's nothing but backstabbing the city of San Jose on the environmental issues."" ???Supporters of the plant see the 14 acres of former junkyard as the perfect site -- right next to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s largest substation in the South Bay, close to major transmission lines and shielded from its neighbors by a 350-foot hill. ???But a housing development is also nearby, and residents fear the power plant will belch pollutants in an area already suffering from some of the worst air quality in the Bay Area. ???Mayor Gonzales continued to express his concern yesterday. ???""I would support clean power plants that will help us achieve greater energy self-sufficiency for San Jose residents and business,"" Gonzales said. ""As the Metcalf project has been designed and proposed to operate, however, it would present an unfair burden on our community."" ???That's not what Davis said, however, calling Metcalf ""one of the cleanest, most efficient plants in the country."" ???Davis praised the efforts of Calpine/Bechtel to work with the local community and said he was especially pleased that the venture had agreed to commit all the power to the local region. ???""The Silicon Valley is obviously the engine driving our economy, but they are very dependent on outside power,"" Davis said. ???Also in Sacramento yesterday, after an hourlong session with Senate Democrats -- the toughest legislative sell for Davis' proposed Edison deal -- the governor all but admitted his plan could not win enough votes for Senate approval. ???""I think he knew there weren't enough votes going in,"" said Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland. ""But there may be a way of perfecting a deal people can at least think of supporting."" ???Senate Democrats have openly opposed Edison's deal, saying the only beneficiaries are Edison shareholders and power generators who would be paid every cent owed them by the utility -- at the expense of customers who would pay more to erase Edison's debt. ???Unlike his meeting with Assembly Democrats, after which Davis said he was encouraged, the governor said yesterday he wanted the Senate to appoint a special committee to iron out differences over the Edison deal. ???Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said he was ""not aware a committee was being set up.""

Hydro's credit to California firms exceeded 1999 guidelines BYLINE: David Baines SOURCE: Vancouver Sun BODY: ??A confidential document issued in late 1999 shows that B.C. Hydro's power-trading subsidiary, Powerex, set a credit limit of $100 million US for its California customers. ??However, by the end of 2000, Powerex had extended three times that amount of credit to those customers -- the California Independent System Operator and the California Power Exchange. With the California Power Exchange and Cal-ISO's major customer, Pacific Gas & Electric, under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, repayment of this debt is now in doubt. ??Powerex spokesman Wayne Cousins noted that the document obtained by The Vancouver Sun, which is marked ""strictly confidential,"" was issued in November 1999. ??""That's an old copy of our risk-management policy,"" he said in an interview Wednesday. ??""Credit limits have changed since then based on careful assessment of several factors including market conditions, risks, maintaining long-standing relationships and helping California meet its electricity needs to prevent crisis situations. ??""Temporary revisions were only implemented after very diligent review incorporating the best market intelligence available, our own due diligence and on-going dialogue with appropriate market participants."" ??He refused to say when the credit limits for Cal-ISO and the California Power Exchange were increased. ??""That type of information is confidential. You have a copy that, I assume, was leaked in some way, but this is commercially confidential information."" ??He said the increase in credit limits helped B.C. Hydro achieve record net income of about $1 billion during the year ending March 31. This figures does not include any write-downs that may occur if Powerex determines that any of its customer accounts are not collectible. ??Cousins, however, was insistent that all debts will be collected: ""We continue to pursue monies owing and we expect to be paid for electricity we have sold."" ??He noted that Powerex suspended trades to all California entities on Dec. 8 unless those trades were fully secured by creditworthy customers. ??By that time, Cal-ISO and California had racked up an unpaid bill of about $ 300 million US, or $475 million Cdn -- about half the net income that Hydro has tentatively reported for the year ending March 31. ??The confidential document states that Powerex's policies and procedures are designed to control ""the risk of financial loss due to changes in market prices or volatility"" and ""the risk that a counterparty (customer) in a commodity transaction defaults on delivery and/or settlement."" ??It states that the amount of credit to be advanced to any customer depends on its credit rating. An ""AAA"" customer, for example, may be granted credit to a maximum of $20 million. ??Cal-ISO and California Power Exchange are not utilities, they are power pools. They purchase power from Powerex and other suppliers and re-sell it to utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. ??The pools are not rated, but are assigned specific credit limits. As of November 1999, Cal-ISO had a credit limit of $40 million US and the California Power Exchange $60 million US. ??The risk-management document notes that the credit-worthiness of these pools depends on that of its suppliers. ??""The Powerex credit-risk manager and the treasury manager are responsible for initially evaluating, and then monitoring, the credit-authorization policies and credit limits for each power pool in which Powerex trades,"" the document states. ""Significant alterations in the credit policies of a power pool will trigger a mandatory reappraisal of the power-pool credit limit."" ??California has been caught in a power vice in recent months. The problem dates back to 1996, when the state developed a plan to deregulate the electricity business. Competition was supposed to lower rates below a price cap that had been imposed. ??However, dry conditions cut the ability to generate hydro-electric power and a surge in the state's economy created unprecedented demand for electricity. Prices soared. ??The result was that the California utilities paid record prices for power, but weren't allowed to pass along the full cost to consumers. ??Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's two biggest utilities, now owe about $12 billion. ??dbaines@pacpress.southam.ca TYPE: Business LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 63 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ?????????????????????April 18, 2001, Wednesday, BC cycle SECTION: Business News LENGTH: 348 words HEADLINE: Williams again target of overcharging allegations from federal regulators DATELINE: TULSA, Okla.

BODY: ??Gov. Mike Johanns and Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., said Wednesday they will be working to make sure national leaders understand Nebraska's stance on a national energy policy. ??Nebraska's unique status as the only 100 percent public power state in the nation and its reliance on the corn-based fuel additive ethanol make the state's input in the development of national energy policy important, Johanns said. ??""Public power has worked very well for Nebraska consumers by providing low cost electricity,"" he said, adding that the deregulated state of California has suffered through weeks of rolling blackouts. ""We are committed to protecting public power in this environment of deregulation."" ??Terry said he has talked at length to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, who has been tapped to come up with a national energy policy draft. That draft will end up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which Terry serves. ??""There will be a discussion about a national deregulation policy,"" Terry said. ??A national deregulation policy would threaten Nebraska's public power system, Terry and Johanns said.

Gray Davis is expected to announce today his support for Calpine Corp.'s proposed South San Jose power plant -- a move that could ensure the state's most controversial power project is built. ??Davis said for months that he would not interfere in the environmental review of the proposed 600-megawatt power plant. But a source close to the governor said Davis has decided to use Calpine's Coyote Valley project to send a signal that California is ready to build more power plants and is ""open to business."" ??San Jose has strenuously opposed the power plant. But Davis' decision to urge the California Energy Commission to approve it would likely hold sway with the agency, which has authority over where plants are located but has almost never overridden local opposition. ??The commission -- three of whose five members were appointed by Davis -- is expected to complete its environmental review and make a decision early this summer. ??A spokesman for the governor declined to confirm the endorsement. But late Tuesday, the governor scheduled a press conference for this morning to make an ""important energy generation announcement."" ??San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales declined to comment. But another of the plant's leading opponents pledged to keep fighting what would be the South Bay's largest power plant. ??An endorsement from Davis would cap a stunning turnaround for the project. ??Five months ago, Calpine's Metcalf Energy Center was unanimously rejected by the San Jose City Council, which decided that the power plant would be incompatible with the city's plans to develop high-tech campuses in North Coyote Valley. ??Some Calpine officials even considered giving up plans to build the power plant. ??But as California's energy woes intensified, the Metcalf plant increasingly became a poster child for the need for more power generation to reduce the skyrocketing cost of electricity and avoid rolling blackouts. Silicon Valley, one of the state's largest electricity consumers, produces only a fraction of the energy it uses. ??Despite fierce opposition from local residents concerned about the environmental effects of a large power plant, a steady stream of state and local organizations lined up behind the project, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce and the local chapters of the Sierra Club and American Lung Association. ??The California Assembly voted unanimously in February to urge the energy commission to override San Jose and license the power plant. ??And top officials and attorneys at the energy commission have been working for months to ensure that the project wins approval, a Mercury News investigation of the commission's environmental review of the project showed. The officials undermined negative environmental assessments of the Metcalf site and silenced commission analysts who said other sites would be better. ??The energy commissioners are weighing the staff's recommendation to approve the plant. ??Commissioner Robert A. Laurie, who oversaw hearings on the project, insisted at one hearing two months ago that the commission would complete an independent review. ??Although Davis has stressed his efforts to speed construction of new power plants, the governor insisted he would not take a position on the project. ??""The governor has repeatedly said he wants the process to play out,"" Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said last week. ""The governor believes the energy commission should complete its review."" ??But there have been growing signs that Davis would throw his weight behind Calpine's project. ??A senior energy commission official said aides to the governor have been calling the commission for months to urge quick approval of the Metcalf plant. The governor's press secretary said no calls have been made. ??When Davis was looking for a backdrop to hold a press conference earlier this year to announce his plans to speed up approval of new power plants, he chose Calpine's new plant in Sutter. ??The company also has actively campaigned for the governor's support. ??Earlier this year, Calpine offered to sell the state cheaper power from the plant if it is approved. ??When Calpine and its development partner Bechtel Enterprises were looking for a lobbyist in Sacramento, the companies turned to Platinum Advisors, whose president, Darius Anderson, was finance chairman of Davis' 1998 gubernatorial campaign. ??The San Jose-based company gave the governor $ 19,000 last year, according to state campaign finance reports. ??Maviglio said the governor's ties to Calpine are no different from his relationship with Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers, who has opposed the power plant. Campaign finance reports show Chambers gave Davis $ 50,000 last year. ??Calpine officials said Tuesday they did not know of the governor's impending announcement. But they said they were not surprised. ""We've been working with the governor on a number of issues,"" said project manager Ken Abreu. ""Metcalf is just one of them."" ??Meanwhile, Calpine's opponents in San Jose City Hall and in the neighborhood nearest the proposed power plant appear more isolated than at any time since the contentious debate over the Metcalf site began more than two years ago. ??Mayor Gonzales refused to comment on Davis' planned announcement. ""I don't respond to rumors,"" said the mayor, who has helped lead opposition to Metcalf. ""I have not heard anything. If he makes a statement, I'll respond."" ??But one of Calpine's fiercest local opponents said the nearby Santa Teresa neighborhood will continue to fight. ""We have a strong case,"" said longtime South San Jose resident Issa Ajlouny. ""And we will win."" ??The Mercury News strives to avoid use of unnamed sources.

BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis indicated Wednesday that he may need to alter the agreement to purchase Southern California Edison's transmission lines if he wants legislators to approve the deal. ??Though the Democratic governor declined to discuss particulars, he said he asked Senate leaders to appoint a special committee dedicated to resolving disagreements between the administration and lawmakers. ??Many provisions of the memorandum of understanding, the document that lays out the terms of the Edison deal, must be approved by the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission. ??""There is a determination to try and solve this problem whether or not it means amending the MOU or trying a slightly different approach,"" Davis said after meeting with Senate Democrats. ??A spokesman for the utility declined to comment on the governor's statements. ??Davis announced the Edison agreement April 9, just three days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unexpectedly cut off transmission line negotiations with the governor and filed for bankruptcy protection. ??The deal would require the state to pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission lines, or 2.3 times book value. In addition, a portion of consumer electricity rates would be dedicated to paying off the remainder of the utility's debt, estimated at about $5 billion. ??Both Edison and PG&E stockpiled massive debt when wholesale electricity prices soared. Price caps prevented them from passing along the entire cost of electricity to consumers. ??Since the Edison deal was announced, however, legislators have been critical of certain provisions, suggesting that California consumers will receive little in return for relieving the utility of billions of dollars in debt. ??""It's clear that the deal, as is, could well be problematic,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""This has to do with what's in the bill, what's in it for the people of the state."" ??Lawmakers initially believed they would have little ability to change the agreement, and referred to it as a ""take it or leave it"" deal. ??In fact, the memorandum of understanding itself says the deal can be nullified ""in the event any law is passed, adopted or repealed ... (which) would materially impede or frustrate the ability of the Parties to effectuate all of the elements of the plan as a package."" ??But in his meeting with Senate Democrats, Davis indicated he may be willing to compromise. His goal, he said, is to keep Edison from following PG&E into bankruptcy. ??""We still have some work to do,"" Davis said. ""I think the appointment of a special Senate committee, assuming that happens, will let us work through the detail in an appropriate fashion."" ??Burton said he has not decided whether to appoint a committee. ??Other senators came out of the meeting guardedly optimistic that they could compromise with the governor. ??""It was obvious that there were concerns from members,"" said Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda. ""He is open and ready to have the proposal perfected as it moves through the legislative process."" ??Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she hopes to amend the deal to ensure power generators are penalized for over-charging the utilities and the state for electricity. ??""The way it's presently crafted, (generators) are being rewarded,"" she said.

""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.",important

NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case. In the alternative, they would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer subject to an appropriate protective order. Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC request for public information. DENA argues that only a three month lag in the release of confidential information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information. Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit. If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it should be subject to a protective order which contains the following: The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket. Only specifically named ""reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review the information. The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises. The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.

NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory commissions and not other participants.

Dave/John if you are happy, perhaps you can ask Kay or Kim to send out under ENA OTC header to distribution list below. David To: ENA VP's and MD's CC: Olson, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, Shankman From: ENA OTC Re: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff Below VP into ENA Effective immediately we have asked the ENA HR department to implement the following changes to procedures to assist us in managing these two very important processes, more consistently and effectively: Hiring of all Commercial Managers or Directors (VP process will remain as is) Business Unit leads and MD's will remain responsible for developing and pursuing speculative talent for their groups and, within their budgets, will also remain responsible for managing their overall headcount. The HR department will continue to support this effort by focusing on providing each of you with a flow of speculative resumes which you should spend time each week reviewing and providing feedback on so that this pipeline can be refined and better targeted. The interviewing process for all Commercial Managers and Directors should be very rigorous and should include at least 2 interviews by VP's in addition to the sponsoring Business Unit lead plus a minimum of 3 senior individuals within the sponsoring group (ie total of 6 in most cases). Effective immediately, once the sponsoring group lead has completed their interviewing process and would like to extend an offer of employment, the candidate must be interviewed by the ENA OTC, before an offer of employment will be released by the HR department. No candidates should be referred to the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and resolved ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the candidate. Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary. John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out of town, these will be conducted via telephone. Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial Staff Effective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows: For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason or justification for offering them a contract. In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction. Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft financial terms on the familiar contract request form. Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail. Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a fresh draft will be produced.

If you or any others intend to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible. The election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final decisions on media spending. Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying firm in Nashville. The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office materials, etc...). Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a stringent campaign finance law. The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up to the business units with interests in Tennessee.
